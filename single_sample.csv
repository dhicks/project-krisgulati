https://openalex.org/W2148497295,Submesoscale dispersion in the vicinity of the <i>Deepwater Horizon</i> spill,,"Reliable forecasts for the dispersion of oceanic contamination are important for coastal ecosystems, society and the economy as evidenced by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 and the Fukushima nuclear plant incident in the Pacific Ocean in 2011. Accurate prediction of pollutant pathways and concentrations at the ocean surface requires understanding ocean dynamics over a broad range of spatial scales. Fundamental questions concerning the structure of the velocity field at the submesoscales (100 meters to tens of kilometers, hours to days) remain unresolved due to a lack of synoptic measurements at these scales. \textcolor{black} {Using high-frequency position data provided by the near-simultaneous release of hundreds of accurately tracked surface drifters, we study the structure of submesoscale surface velocity fluctuations in the Northern Gulf Mexico. Observed two-point statistics confirm the accuracy of classic turbulence scaling laws at 200m$-$50km scales and clearly indicate that dispersion at the submesoscales is \textit{local}, driven predominantly by energetic submesoscale fluctuations.} The results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of deploying large clusters of drifting instruments to provide synoptic observations of spatial variability of the ocean surface velocity field.

https://openalex.org/W2783382583,Ocean convergence and the dispersion of flotsam,,"Floating oil, plastics, and marine organisms are continually redistributed by ocean surface currents. Prediction of their resulting distribution on the surface is a fundamental, long-standing, and practically important problem. The dominant paradigm is dispersion within the dynamical context of a nondivergent flow: objects initially close together will on average spread apart but the area of surface patches of material does not change. Although this paradigm is likely valid at mesoscales, larger than 100 km in horizontal scale, recent theoretical studies of submesoscales (less than ∼10 km) predict strong surface convergences and downwelling associated with horizontal density fronts and cyclonic vortices. Here we show that such structures can dramatically concentrate floating material. More than half of an array of ∼200 surface drifters covering ∼20 × 20 km 2 converged into a 60 × 60 m region within a week, a factor of more than 10 5 decrease in area, before slowly dispersing. As predicted, the convergence occurred at density fronts and with cyclonic vorticity. A zipperlike structure may play an important role. Cyclonic vorticity and vertical velocity reached 0.001 s −1 and 0.01 ms −1 , respectively, which is much larger than usually inferred. This suggests a paradigm in which nearby objects form submesoscale clusters, and these clusters then spread apart. Together, these effects set both the overall extent and the finescale texture of a patch of floating material. Material concentrated at submesoscale convergences can create unique communities of organisms, amplify impacts of toxic material, and create opportunities to more efficiently recover such material.",2018-02-06,NA,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://openalex.org/V125754415,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1718453115,1162,1167,115,6,TRUE,142,,2018,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2783382583,,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1718453115,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W1966392728,Improving Oceanic Overflow Representation in Climate Models: The Gravity Current Entrainment Climate Process Team,,"Abstract Oceanic overflows are bottom-trapped density currents originating in semienclosed basins, such as the Nordic seas, or on continental shelves, such as the Antarctic shelf. Overflows are the source of most of the abyssal waters, and therefore play an important role in the large-scale ocean circulation, forming a component of the sinking branch of the thermohaline circulation. As they descend the continental slope, overflows mix vigorously with the surrounding oceanic waters, changing their density and transport significantly. These mixing processes occur on spatial scales well below the resolution of ocean climate models, with the result that deep waters and deep western boundary currents are simulated poorly.

https://openalex.org/W2114113819,Assimilation of drifter observations for the reconstruction of the Eulerian circulation field,,"[1] In light of the increasing number of drifting buoys in the ocean and recent advances in the realism of ocean general circulation models toward oceanic forecasting, the problem of assimilation of Lagrangian observations data in Eulerian models is investigated. A new and general rigorous approach is developed based on optimal interpolation (OI) methods, which takes into account directly the Lagrangian nature of the observations. An idealized version of this general formulation is tested in the framework of identical twin experiments using a reduced gravity, quasi-geostrophic model. An extensive study is conducted to quantify the effectiveness of Lagrangian data assimilation as a function of the number of drifters, the frequency of assimilation, and the uncertainties associated with the forcing functions driving the ocean model. The performance of the Lagrangian assimilation technique is also compared to that of conventional methods of assimilating drifters as moving current meters, and assimilation of Eulerian data, such as fixed-point velocities. Overall, the results are very favorable for the assimilation of Lagrangian observations to improve the Eulerian velocity field in ocean models. The results of our assimilation twin experiments imply an optimal sampling frequency for oceanic Lagrangian instruments in the range of 20–50% of the Lagrangian integral timescale of the flow field.

https://openalex.org/W2761542745,A Biodegradable Surface Drifter for Ocean Sampling on a Massive Scale,,"Abstract Targeted observations of submesoscale currents are necessary to improve science’s understanding of oceanic mixing, but these dynamics occur at spatiotemporal scales that are currently challenging to detect. Prior studies have recently shown that the submesoscale surface velocity field can be measured by tracking hundreds of surface drifters released in tight arrays. This strategy requires drifter positioning to be accurate, frequent, and to last for several weeks. However, because of the large numbers involved, drifters must be low-cost, compact, easy to handle, and also made of materials harmless to the environment. Therefore, the novel Consortium for Advanced Research on Transport of Hydrocarbon in the Environment (CARTHE) drifter was designed following these criteria to facilitate massive sampling of near-surface currents during the Lagrangian Submesoscale Experiment (LASER). The drifting characteristics were determined under a wide range of currents, waves, and wind conditions in laboratory settings. Results showed that the drifter accurately follows the currents in the upper 0.60 m, that it presents minimal wave rectification issues, and that its wind-induced slip velocity is less than 0.5% of the neutral wind speed at 10 m. In experiments conducted in both coastal and deep ocean conditions under wind speeds up to 10 m s −1 , the trajectories of the traditional Coastal Ocean Dynamics Experiment (CODE) and the CARTHE drifters were nearly identical. Following these tests, 1100 units were produced and deployed during the LASER campaign, successfully tracking submesoscale and mesoscale features in the Gulf of Mexico. It is hoped that this drifter will enable high-density sampling near metropolitan areas subject to stress by the overpopulation, such as lakes, rivers, estuaries, and environmentally sensitive areas, such as the Arctic.",2017-11-29,NA,Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology,https://openalex.org/V135937692,American Meteorological Society,,https://journals.ametsoc.org/downloadpdf/journals/atot/34/11/jtech-d-17-0055.1.pdf,2509,2532,34,11,TRUE,81,,2017,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2761542745,,https://doi.org/10.1175/jtech-d-17-0055.1,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W2125654295,The LatMix Summer Campaign: Submesoscale Stirring in the Upper Ocean,,"Abstract Lateral stirring is a basic oceanographic phenomenon affecting the distribution of physical, chemical, and biological fields. Eddy stirring at scales on the order of 100 km (the mesoscale) is fairly well understood and explicitly represented in modern eddy-resolving numerical models of global ocean circulation. The same cannot be said for smaller-scale stirring processes. Here, the authors describe a major oceanographic field experiment aimed at observing and understanding the processes responsible for stirring at scales of 0.1–10 km. Stirring processes of varying intensity were studied in the Sargasso Sea eddy field approximately 250 km southeast of Cape Hatteras. Lateral variability of water-mass properties, the distribution of microscale turbulence, and the evolution of several patches of inert dye were studied with an array of shipboard, autonomous, and airborne instruments. Observations were made at two sites, characterized by weak and moderate background mesoscale straining, to contrast different regimes of lateral stirring. Analyses to date suggest that, in both cases, the lateral dispersion of natural and deliberately released tracers was O(1) m2 s–1 as found elsewhere, which is faster than might be expected from traditional shear dispersion by persistent mesoscale flow and linear internal waves. These findings point to the possible importance of kilometer-scale stirring by submesoscale eddies and nonlinear internal-wave processes or the need to modify the traditional shear-dispersion paradigm to include higher-order effects. A unique aspect of the Scalable Lateral Mixing and Coherent Turbulence (LatMix) field experiment is the combination of direct measurements of dye dispersion with the concurrent multiscale hydrographic and turbulence observations, enabling evaluation of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the observed dispersion at a new level.",2015-09-16,NA,Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society,https://openalex.org/V140302479,American Meteorological Society,,NA,1257,1279,96,8,FALSE,80,,2015,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2125654295,,https://doi.org/10.1175/bams-d-14-00015.1,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W2099177919,Three-Dimensional Turbulent Bottom Density Currents from a High-Order Nonhydrostatic Spectral Element Model,,"Overflows are bottom gravity currents that supply dense water masses generated in high-latitude and marginal seas into the general circulation. Oceanic observations have revealed that mixing of overflows with ambient water masses takes place over small spatial and time scales. Studies with ocean general circulation models indicate that the strength of the thermohaline circulation is strongly sensitive to representation of overflows in these models. In light of these results, overflow-induced mixing emerges as one of the prominent oceanic processes. In this study, as a continuation of an effort to develop appropriate process models for overflows, nonhydrostatic 3D simulations of bottom gravity are carried out that would complement analysis of dedicated observations and large-scale ocean modeling. A parallel high-order spectral-element Navier‐Stokes solver is used as the basis of the simulations. Numerical experiments are conducted in an idealized setting focusing on the startup phase of a dense water mass released at the top of a sloping wedge. Results from 3D experiments are compared with results from 2D experiments and laboratory experiments, based on propagation speed of the density front, growth rate of the characteristic head at the leading edge, turbulent overturning length scales, and entrainment parameters. Results from 3D experiments are found to be in general agreement with those from laboratory tank experiments. In 2D simulations, the propagation speed is approximately 20% slower than that of the 3D experiments and the head growth rate is 3 times as large, Thorpe scales are 1.3‐1.5 times as large, and the entrainment parameter is up to 2 times as large as those in the 3D experiments. The differences between 2D and 3D simulations are entirely due to internal factors associated with the truncation of the Navier‐Stokes equations for 2D approximation.",2004-09-01,NA,Journal of Physical Oceanography,https://openalex.org/V162372621,American Meteorological Society,,NA,2006,2026,34,9,FALSE,72,,2004,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2099177919,,https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0485(2004)034<2006:ttbdcf>2.0.co;2,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W2172723972,On the Predictability of Lagrangian Trajectories in the Ocean,,"The predictability of particle trajectories in oceanic flows is investigated in the context of a primitive equation, idealized, double-gyre ocean model. This study is motivated not only by the fact that this is an important conceptual problem but also by practical applications, such as searching for objects lost at sea, and ecological problems, such as the spreading of pollutants or fish larvae. The original aspect of this study is the use of Lagrangian drifter data to improve the accuracy of predicted trajectories. The prediction is performed by assimilating velocity data from the surrounding drifters into a Gauss–Markov model for particle motion. The assimilation is carried out using a simplified Kalman filter. The performance of the prediction scheme is quantified as a function of a number of factors: 1) dynamically different flow regimes, such as interior gyre, western boundary current, and midlatitude jet regions; 2) density of drifter data used in assimilation; and 3) uncertainties in the knowledge of the mean flow field and the initial conditions. The data density is quantified by the number of data per degrees of freedom NR, defined as the number of drifters within the typical Eulerian space scale from the prediction particle. The simulations indicate that the actual World Ocean Circulation Experiment sampling (1 particle/[5° × 5°] or NR ≪ 1) does not improve particle prediction, but predictions improve significantly when NR ≫ 1. For instance, a coverage of 1 particle/[1° × 1°] or NR ∼ O(1) is already able to reduce the errors of about one-third or one-half. If the sampling resolution is increased to 1 particle/[0.5° × 0.5°] or 1 particle/[0.25° × 0.25°] or NR ≫ 1, reasonably accurate predictions (rms errors of less than 50 km) can be obtained for periods ranging from one week (western boundary current and midlatitude jet regions) to three months (interior gyre region). Even when the mean flow field and initial turbulent velocities are not known accurately, the information derived from the surrounding drifter data is shown to compensate when NR > 1. Theoretical error estimates are derived that are based on the main statistical parameters of the flow field. Theoretical formulas show good agreement with the numerical results, and hence, they may serve as useful a priori estimates of Lagrangian prediction error for practical applications.",2000-03-01,NA,Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology,https://openalex.org/V135937692,American Meteorological Society,,https://journals.ametsoc.org/downloadpdf/journals/atot/17/3/1520-0426_2000_017_0366_otpolt_2_0_co_2.pdf,366,383,17,3,TRUE,71,,2000,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2172723972,,https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0426(2000)017<0366:otpolt>2.0.co;2,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W2372456297,"The Gulf of Mexico ecosystem, six years after the Macondo oil well blowout",,"Abstract The Gulf of Mexico ecosystem is a hotspot for biological diversity and supports a number of industries, from tourism to fishery production to oil and gas exploration, that serve as the economic backbone of Gulf coast states. The Gulf is a natural hydrocarbon basin, rich with stores of oil and gas that lie in reservoirs deep beneath the seafloor. The natural seepage of hydrocarbons across the Gulf system is extensive and, thus, the system׳s biological components experience ephemeral, if not, frequent, hydrocarbon exposure. In contrast to natural seepage, which is diffuse and variable over space and time, the 2010 Macondo oil well blowout, represented an intense, focused hydrocarbon infusion to the Gulf׳s deepwaters. The Macondo blowout drove rapid shifts in microbial populations and activity, revealed unexpected phenomena, such as deepwater hydrocarbon plumes and marine “oil snow” sedimentation, and impacted the Gulf׳s pelagic and benthic ecosystems. Understanding the distribution and fate of Macondo oil was limited to some degree by an insufficient ability to predict the physical movement of water in the Gulf. In other words, the available physical oceanographic models lacked critical components. In the past six years, much has been learned about the physical oceanography of the Gulf, providing transformative knowledge that will improve the ability to predict the movement of water and the hydrocarbons they carry in future blowout scenarios. Similarly, much has been learned about the processing and fate of Macondo hydrocarbons. Here, we provide an overview of the distribution, fate and impacts of Macondo hydrocarbons and offer suggestions for future research to push the field of oil spill response research forward.",2016-07-01,NA,Deep-sea Research Part Ii-topical Studies in Oceanography,https://openalex.org/V172051550,Elsevier,,NA,4,19,129,NA,FALSE,68,,2016,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2372456297,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr2.2016.04.018,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W2071874398,Relative dispersion from a high-resolution coastal model of the Adriatic Sea,,"Abstract Synthetic drifter trajectories computed from velocity data produced by a high-resolution NCOM model are used to investigate the scaling of relative dispersion and the distribution of finite-scale Lyapunov exponent (FSLE) fields in the Adriatic Sea. The effects of varying degrees of spatial and temporal filtering of the input Eulerian velocity fields on the Lagrangian statistics are investigated in order to assess the sensitivity of such statistics to model error. It is shown that the relative dispersion in the model Adriatic circulation is generally super-diffusive, scaling nearly ballistically in close agreement with Lagrangian observations from a limited set of drifters. The large-scale dispersion is dominated by persistent separation regions and the controlling influence of the Western Adriatic Current (WAC). Temporal filtering with averaging windows up to monthly time scales only affects the relative dispersion at scales smaller than 20 km without altering the overall scaling regime. In contrast, spatial smoothing at scales as small as 5 km significantly reduces relative dispersion at all scales up to 100 km. While basin-scale dispersion statistics are strongly dependent on spatial resolution of the model WAC, maps of FSLE fields over initial conditions indicate that the detailed geometry of the dispersion is determined to a large extent by the temporal resolution of the model. In addition, the degree of spatial heterogeneity in the flow field implies that the existence, or non-existence, of a distinct exponential regime in the FSLE at small scales is extremely sensitive to the details of particle pair sampling strategies.",2008-01-01,NA,Ocean Modelling,https://openalex.org/V33756829,Elsevier,,NA,48,65,22,1-2,FALSE,67,,2008,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2071874398,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2008.01.006,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W2108923498,On the Connection between the Mediterranean Outflow and the Azores Current,,"As the salty and dense Mediteranean overflow exits the Strait of Gibraltar and descends rapidly in the Gulf of Cadiz, it entrains the fresher overlying subtropical Atlantic Water. A minimal model is put forth in this study to show that the entrainment process associated with the Mediterranean outflow in the Gulf of Cadiz can impact the upper-ocean circulation in the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean and can be a fundamental factor in the establishment of the Azores Current. Two key simplifications are applied in the interest of producing an economical model that captures the dominant effects. The first is to recognize that in a vertically asymmetric twolayer system, a relatively shallow upper layer can be dynamically approximated as a single-layer reduced-gravity controlled barotropic system, and the second is to apply quasigeostrophic dynamics such that the volume flux divergence effect associated with the entrainment is represented as a source of potential vorticity. Two sets of computations are presented within the 1‰-layer framework. A primitive-equation-based computation, which includes the divergent flow effects, is first compared with the equivalent quasigeostrophic formulation. The upper-ocean cyclonic eddy generated by the loss of mass over a localized area elongates westward under the influence of the b effect until the flow encounters the western boundary. In the steady state, the circulation pattern consists of bidirectional zonal flows with a limited meridional extent: eastward to the south of the sink and westward to the north of the sink. The localized sink drives a horizontal circulation in the interior ocean whose strength is approximately an order of magnitude greater than the sink’s strength. It is demonstrated that the induced circulation in the far field from a localized sink is insensitive to the neglect of the divergent flow component. A set of parameter sensitivity experiments is then undertaken with the quasigeostrophic model for an idealized midlatitude circulation, driven both by wind forcing and ‘‘thermohaline’’ flow through the open southern and northern boundaries. When a sink near the eastern boundary is superimposed on the idealized midlatitude circulation, it is shown to alter significantly the upper-ocean flow and induce an eastward zonal current, which resembles the Azores Current in location and transport. This mechanism also generates a westward current to the north of the sink location, which could be associated with the Azores Countercurrent. An extensive series of sensitivity experiments is conducted to determine the response of this current system to changes in the boundary layer processes, sink strength, sink distribution, model resolution, and wind forcing. The magnitude of the current transports is found to be sensitive to the sink intensity and to its distance from the coastline.",2001-02-01,NA,Journal of Physical Oceanography,https://openalex.org/V162372621,American Meteorological Society,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,66,,2001,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2108923498,,https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0485(2001)031<0461:otcbtm>2.0.co;2,journal-article,,,

In each case, particle dispersion at large time and space scales is found to be controlled by energetic meso-scale features of the flow that are relatively insensitive to the resolution of finer scale motions. In all cases, time-distance graphs given in terms of computed Finite Scale Lyapunov Exponents show an expected increase in the extent of exponential scaling with increasing spatial smoothing of the velocity field.

https://openalex.org/W2127939561,Large eddy simulation of stratified mixing in two-dimensional dam-break problem in a rectangular enclosed domain,,"Abstract Mixing in both coastal and deep ocean emerges as one of the important processes that determines the transport of pollutants, sediments and biological species, as well as the details of the global thermohaline circulation. Both the observations, due to their lack in space and time resolution, and most coastal and general circulation models due to inadequate physics, can only provide partial information about oceanic mixing processes. A new class of nonhydrostatic models supplemented with physically based subgrid-scale (SGS) closures, or so-called large eddy simulation ( LES ), is put forth as another tool of investigation to complement observational and large-scale modeling efforts. However, SGS models have been developed primarily for homogeneous, isotropic flows. Here, four SGS models based on Smagorinsky eddy viscosity and diffusivity are tested for stratified flows in the context of 2D dam-break problem in a rectangular enclosed domain. This idealized testbed leads to a number of simplifications about the initial conditions, boundary conditions and geometry, while exhibiting the dynamically complex characteristics of stratified flows involving the interaction of shear-induced mixing and internal waves. Direct numerical simulations ( DNS ) at high resolutions are taken as benchmark solutions. Under-resolved simulations without SGS terms (so-called DNS ∗) are used to quantify the impact of SGS stresses. The performance of LES is assessed by using the time evolution of the volume fraction of intermediate density water masses generated by mixing. The simulations are conducted using a nonhydrostatic high-order spectral element model Nek5000 developed to exhibit minimal numerical dissipation and dispersion errors, which is advantageous to quantify accurately the impact of SGS stresses. It is found that all tested SGS models lead to improved results with respect to those from DNS ∗. Also, SGS models allow for simulations with coarse resolutions that blow up in DNS ∗ due to lack of adequate dissipation where needed. The SGS model in which the vertical eddy diffusion is modulated via a function that depends on the Richardson number Ri shows the most faithful reproduction of mixed water masses at all resolutions tested. The sensitivity of the results to the tunable parameter of the SGS model, to changes in the Ri-dependent function and resolution of the turbulent overturning scales is shown.",2007-01-01,NA,Ocean Modelling,https://openalex.org/V33756829,Elsevier,,NA,106,140,16,1-2,FALSE,63,,2007,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2127939561,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2006.08.006,journal-article,,,

In our illustrative example, the current magnitude averaged over the upper 1 cm of the ocean is shown to be nearly four times the average over the upper 10 m, even for mild forcing. Our findings indicate that this shear will rapidly separate pieces of marine debris which vary in size or buoyancy, making consideration of these dynamics essential to an improved understanding of the pathways along which marine plastics and oil are transported.",2018-01-16,NA,Geophysical Research Letters,https://openalex.org/V36624081,Wiley,,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/2017GL075891,245,249,45,1,TRUE,61,,2018,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2771523235,,https://doi.org/10.1002/2017gl075891,journal-article,,,

https://openalex.org/W2039711807,Predictability of Lagrangian particle trajectories: Effects of smoothing of the underlying Eulerian flow,,"The increasing realism of ocean circulation models is leading to an increasing use of Eulerian models as a basis to compute transport properties and to predict the fate of Lagrangian quantities. There exists, however, a signie cant gap between the spatial scales of model resolution and that of forces acting on Lagrangian particles. These scales may contain high vorticity coherent structures that are not resolved due to computational issues and/or missing dynamics and are typically suppressed by smoothing operators. In this study, the impact of smoothing of the Eulerian e elds on the predictability of Lagrangian particles is e rst investigated by conducting twin experiments that involve release of clusters of synthetic Lagrangian particles into “ true” (unmodie ed) and “ model” (smoothed) Eulerian e elds, which are generated by a QG model with a e ow e eld consisting of many turbulent coherent structures. The Lagrangian errors induced by Eulerian smoothing errors are quantie ed by using two metrics, the difference between the centers of mass (CM) of particle clusters, r, and the difference between scattering of particles around the center of mass, s. The results show that the smoothing has a strong effect on the CM behavior, while the scatter around it is only partially affected. The QG results are then compared to results obtained from a multi-particle Lagrangian Stochastic Model (LSM) which parameterizes turbulent e ow using main e ow characteristics such as mean e ow, velocity variance and Lagrangian time scale. In addition to numerical results, theoretical results based on the LSM are also considered, providing asymptotics of r, s and predictability time. It is shown that both numerical and theoretical LSM results for the center of mass error ( r) provide a good qualitative description, and a quantitatively satisfactory estimate of results from QG experiments. The scatter error ( s) results, on the other hand, are only qualitatively reproduced by the LSM.",2004-01-01,NA,Journal of Marine Research,https://openalex.org/V166958622,Journal of Marine Research/Yale,,NA,1,35,62,1,FALSE,59,,2004,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2039711807,,https://doi.org/10.1357/00222400460744609,journal-article,,,

In this paper, the joint effects of (a) coastline orientation, (b) bottom topography, and (c) inertia on the midlatitude jet separation are explored in a wind-driven two-layer quasigeostrophic model. It is shown that topographic effects are of importance in high eddy activity regions and that eddy–topography interactions strongly influence the separation process. In order for the western boundary current to separate from the coastline and cross the f/h contours associated with the continental rise, eddy fluctuations need to be weak at the separation point. This can be achieved either by introducing a positive wind stress curl in the northern part of the domain or by increasing the inertia of the western boundary current. In both cases, the separation is facilitated by low eddy activity, resulting in a decoupling of the upper layer from the lower layer when the current crosses the f/h contours.",1997-11-01,NA,Journal of Physical Oceanography,https://openalex.org/V162372621,American Meteorological Society,,https://journals.ametsoc.org/downloadpdf/journals/phoc/27/11/1520-0485_1997_027_2460_iowfbt_2.0.co_2.pdf,2460,2476,27,11,TRUE,57,,1997,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2103606517,,https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0485(1997)027<2460:iowfbt>2.0.co;2,journal-article,,,

A persistent coastal front driven by river outflows in the North‐Western Mediterranean Sea is targeted by two observational cruises conducted in the summer of 2010. The frontal zone is sampled using drifters launched with a multi‐scale strategy consisting of modules of triplets, released on either side of the front by small boats. This experiment is original in that the submesoscale range of 100 m to 1000 m is directly targeted, and the results are expected to provide guidance for practical applications, such as prediction of the initial spreading of pollutants and biogeochemical tracers. The influence of submesoscale motions on relative dispersion is quantified using both particle mean square separation as a function of time, and scale‐dependent finite‐size Lyapunov exponents (FSLE,λ(δ)). Our main finding is the identification of a local dispersion regime with values reaching as high as λ ≈ 20 days−1 at drifter pair separation distances of δ < 100 m. This value is more than an order of magnitude greater than that obtained by drifters in the offshore Ligurian current. The Ligurian Sea circulation is modeled using a fully realistic Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) with 1/60° horizontal resolution. It is found that the numerical model significantly underestimates the relative dispersion at submesoscales, indicating the need for particle dispersion parameterizations for unresolved processes.",2012-06-01,NA,Geophysical Research Letters,https://openalex.org/V36624081,Wiley,,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2012GL051879,n/a,n/a,39,11,TRUE,56,,2012,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W1907867021,,https://doi.org/10.1029/2012gl051879,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W1966952868,Relative dispersion in the Liguro-Provençal basin: From sub-mesoscale to mesoscale,,"Abstract Relative dispersion in the Liguro-Provencal basin (a subregion of the Mediterranean Sea) is investigated using clusters of surface drifters deployed during two Marine Rapid Environment Assessment (MREA) experiments covering different months in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The clusters have initial radii of less than 1 km, or an order of magnitude below a typical deformation radius (approximately 10–20 km). The data set consists of 45 original pairs and more than 50 total pairs (including chance ones) in the spatial range between 1 and 200 km. Relative dispersion is estimated using the mean square separation of particle pairs and the Finite Scale Lyapunov Exponents (FSLEs). The two metrics show broadly consistent results, indicating in particular a clear exponential behaviour with an e-folding time scale between 0.5 and 1 days, or Lyapunov exponent λ in the range of 0.7–1 days−1. The exponential phase extends for 4–7 days in time and between 1 and 10–20 km in separation space. To our knowledge, this is only the third time that an exponential regime is observed in the world ocean from drifter data. This result suggests that relative dispersion in the Liguro-Provencal basin is nonlocal, namely controlled mainly by mesoscale dynamics, and that the effects of the sub-mesoscale motions are negligible in comparison.

Isaac was observed by 194 surface drifters during the Grand Lagrangian Deployment (GLAD). A coupled atmosphere-wave-ocean model was used to forecast hurricane impacts during GLAD. The coupled model and drifter observations provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the impacts of hurricane-induced Stokes drift on ocean surface currents. The Stokes drift induced a cyclonic (anticyclonic) rotational flow on the left (right) side of the hurricane and accounted for up to 20% of the average Lagrangian velocity.

https://openalex.org/W2000496270,Large eddy simulation of stratified mixing in a three-dimensional lock-exchange system,,"Abstract Accurate and computationally-efficient modeling of stratified mixing processes are of paramount importance in both coastal and large-scale ocean circulation. In this study, our main objective is to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of large eddy simulation ( LES ) as a possible tool to study small-scale oceanic processes. To this end, LES is evaluated in a 3D lock-exchange problem, which contains shear-driven mixing, internal waves, interactions with boundaries and convective motions, while having a simple domain, initial and boundary conditions, and forcing. Two general classes of LES models are tested, namely eddy viscosity (EV) models based on constant–coefficient and dynamic Smagorinsky models, and an approximate deconvolution (AD) model. By noting that the dynamic Smagorinsky and AD models have different strengths in that the former is good in providing appropriate dissipation while the latter in preserving the detail of coherent structures on coarse resolution meshes, a hybrid approach combining EV and AD models is also evaluated. A direct numerical simulation ( DNS ) is performed as the benchmark solution, and all LES models are tested on three coarse meshes. The main measure of mixing is taken as the temporal evolution of background potential energy. It is found that constant-coefficient Smagorinsky models can only provide a marginal improvement over under-resolved simulations, while both dynamic Smagorinsky and AD models lead to significant improvements in mixing accuracy. The primary accomplishment of this study is that it is shown that the hybrid approach attains the best agreement with the mixing curve from DNS, while being computationally approximately a thousand times faster.",2009-01-01,NA,Ocean Modelling,https://openalex.org/V33756829,Elsevier,,NA,134,155,26,3-4,FALSE,52,,2009,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2000496270,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2008.09.006,journal-article,,,

Recent observations and advances in our understanding of ocean processes indicate there is an explosion of flow instabilities in the submesoscale range. While submesoscale flows have a significant impact on transport at their own scales, they require much more extensive data sets and numerical computations. Therefore, transport carried out by submesoscale flows is quite challenging to approach deterministically. In this study, we put forward a hybrid approach by combining deterministic Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) to compute transport over the mesoscale range with statistical Lagrangian subgridscale (LSGS) models for the underresolved submesoscale motions. We apply this approach to particle transport in the Gulf Stream region, which exhibits indications of submesoscale activity from both models and observations. We consider HYCOM solutions at two resolutions. In the 1/12° computation, mesoscale features are well resolved but submesoscales are not resolved, while the 1/48° computation captures some of the submesoscale flow instabilities as well. By using metrics of relative dispersion, we investigate three LSGS models and demonstrate that they can be useful in correcting the underestimation of submesoscale dispersion in the 1/12° solution, with respect to relative dispersion obtained from the 1/48° solution and an observational result.",2012-01-01,NA,Ocean Modelling,https://openalex.org/V33756829,Elsevier,,NA,31,49,42,NA,FALSE,49,,2012,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2035976062,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2011.11.005,journal-article,,,

The model explicitly resolves the Kelvin‐Helmholtz instability, the main mechanism of mixing in nonrotating bottom gravity currents. A series of experiments were conducted to explore the impact of density difference and slope angle on the dynamics of bottom gravity currents in a nonrotating and homogeneous environment. The features of the simulated currents; that is, a characteristic head at the leading edge and lumped vortices in the trailing fluid, agree qualitatively well with those observed in laboratory experiments. Quantitative comparisons of speed of descent indicate that laboratory results remain valid at geophysical scales. Two distinct regimes of entrainment of ambient fluid into bottom gravity currents are identified: (i) the laminar entrainment regime is associated with the initial growth of the characteristic head due to the drag exerted by the fresh fluid in front and (ii) the turbulent entrainment is associated with the Kelvin‐Helmholtz instabilities. The turbulent entrainment is found to be much stronger than the laminar entrainment, and entrainment in the turbulent regime is less sensitive to the slope angle than that in the laminar regime. The entrainment is quantified as a function of basic parameters of the system, the buoyancy flux and the slope angle, for the purpose of parameterizing the mixing induced by bottom gravity currents.",2002-05-01,NA,Journal of Physical Oceanography,https://openalex.org/V162372621,American Meteorological Society,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,47,,2002,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2143775138,,https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0485(2002)032<1460:dotdtb>2.0.co;2,journal-article,,,

A set of 295 drifters deployed in July 2012 in the north-eastern Gulf of Mexico provides a unique opportunity to test these systems down to scales previously unobtainable. In this study, background error covariance assumptions in the 3DVar assimilation process are perturbed to understand the effect on the solution relative to the withheld dense drifter data. Results show that the amplitude of the background error covariance is an important factor as expected, and a proposed new formulation provides added skill. In addition, the background error covariance time correlation is important to allow satellite observations to affect the results over a period longer than one daily assimilation cycle. The results show the new background error covariance formulations provide more accurate placement of frontal positions, directions of currents and velocity magnitudes.

https://openalex.org/W2103464127,Performance of two-equation turbulence closures in three-dimensional simulations of the Red Sea overflow,,"Abstract Mixing of overflows released from polar and marginal seas is a key process shaping the structure of the meridional overturning circulation. Ocean general circulation models have difficulty in resolving the overflows, and therefore they must rely on parameterizations. In this study, the performance of a set of turbulence closures in reproducing mixing of an overflow is quantified. We simulate the Red Sea overflow by employing standard k – e , k – ω and Mellor–Yamada schemes with various stability functions, as well as a modified k – e model that relies on the prescription of the turbulent Prandtl number rather than on stability functions. The simpler KPP mixing scheme and experiments without turbulent fluxes serve as useful references. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the performance of two-equation turbulence models has been examined so closely using data from an overflow. It is found that without turbulence closures, the hydrodynamic model has difficulty in reproducing the correct three-dimensional pathway of the Red Sea overflow, consisting of a distinct bifurcation into two diverging channels. All turbulence models capture the vertical structure of this overflow consisting of an interfacial layer, characterized by the density gradient, and a well-mixed bottom layer. Mean eddy diffusivity values from most closures are comparable those from observations. But we find that KPP leads to eddy diffusivity values that are too small while those from Mellor–Yamada with Galperin [Galperin, B., Kantha, L.H., Hassid, S., Rosati, A., 1988. A quasi-equilibrium turbulent energy model for geophysical flows. J. Atmos. Sci. 45, 55–62] stability functions are too large. Such high diffusivities lead to excessive mixing in the bottom layer of the overflow, ultimately resulting in a salinity deficit of approximately 1 psu in the product water mass. Salinity deviations between the models and observations are quantified using both data taken along the channels and two sections across the overflow. KPP and Mellor–Yamada with Galperin (1988) stability functions produce the largest deviations from the observations, while the modified k – e exhibits the smallest deviations. The other four closures fall in between, showing results similar to one another. The performance of the Mellor–Yamada turbulence closure is improved considerably by using the stability functions by Kantha and Clayson [Kantha, L.H., Clayson, C.A., 1994. An improved mixed layer model for geophysical applications. J. Geophys. Res. 99 (December), 25235–25266], which allow for a stationary Richardson number of 0.21.

The analysis is conducted using a Gauss-Markov Lagrangian particle model, which relies on the estimate of climatological mean flow field, persistence of turbulence, and assimilation of velocity data from the surrounding drifters through a Kalman filtering technique. The results are described using the data density N R defined as the number of drifters within a distance on the order of the Rossby radius of deformation from the particle to be predicted. The clusters are inherently different with respect to this characteristic property with values ranging from N R <0.5 to N R ≥ 2.0 over the analysis period, depending on the initial launch pattern of the clusters and the dispersion processes. The results indicate that during the period when N R ≥ 1, the assimilation of surrounding drifter data leads to an improvement of predicted trajectories with respect to those based on advecting the drifters with the mean flow. When N R < 1, the drifters are too far apart to exhibit correlated motion, and the assimilation method does not lead to an improvement. The effects of uneertainties in the mean flow field and initial release position are discussed.

https://openalex.org/W2000529584,On the role of bottom roughness in overflows,,"Abstract Overflows play an important role in the downwelling limb of the oceanic thermohaline circulation. In light of the recognition that some overflows are not homogenous but exhibit a vertical density structure, and details of topography influence the pathways of some overflows, the impact of topographic roughness on the product property distribution is explored using the 3D non-hydrostatic spectral element model Nek5000. Numerical experiments are carried out by varying bottom roughness amplitude and ambient stratification parameters, in a regime where equilibrated product water masses are formed in a non-rotating environment. Our main finding is that bottom roughness can influence the overflow product distribution such that the highest salinity classes are removed and neutral buoyancy level is attained higher up in the stratified ambient water column. It is also shown that the form drag coefficients in overflows over rough bottom can be much larger than the skin drag coefficient over smooth bottom. To our knowledge, form drag has never been measured in oceanic overflows. As such, these numerical experiments imply that such measurements would be useful for a better understanding of overflow dynamics. It is also found that the ratio of source and product overflow mass transports is robust to changes in bottom roughness. This appears to happen because the distribution of entrainment is totally different in the case of rough bottom.

https://openalex.org/W2104444967,On multi-scale dispersion under the influence of surface mixed layer instabilities and deep flows,,"Abstract A series of large eddy simulations is used to assess the transport properties of multi-scale ocean flows. In particular, we compare scale-dependent measures of Lagrangian relative dispersion and the evolution of passive tracer releases in models containing only submesoscale mixed layer instabilities and those containing mixed layer instabilities modified by deeper, baroclinic mesoscale disturbances. Visualization through 3D finite-time Lyapunov exponents and spectral analysis show that the small scale instabilities of the mixed layer rapidly lose coherence in the presence of larger-scale straining induced by the mesoscale motion. Eddy diffusivities computed from passive tracer evolution increase by an order of magnitude as the flow transitions from small to large scales. During the time period when both instabilities are present, scale-dependent relative Lagrangian dispersion, given by the finite-scale Lyapunov exponent (λ), shows two distinct plateau regions clearly associated with the disparate instability scales. In this case, the maximum value of λ over the submesocales at the surface flow is three times greater than λ at the mixed layer base which is only influenced by the deeper baroclinic motions. The results imply that parameterizations of submesoscale transport properties may be needed to accurately predict surface dispersion in models that do not explicitly resolve submesoscale turbulent features.",2012-10-01,NA,Ocean Modelling,https://openalex.org/V33756829,Elsevier,,NA,16,30,56,NA,FALSE,41,,2012,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2104444967,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2012.07.004,journal-article,,,

The analysis is conducted by using three techniques with increasing complexity: the center of mass of the cluster, advection by climatological currents, and a new technique that relies on the assimilation of both velocity and position data from the surrounding drifters into a Markov model for particle motion. A detailed mathematical description of the theory leading to this model is given. The predictability of drifter motion in these clusters is characterized using the data density Nd, defined as the number of drifters over an area scaled by the mean diameter of the cluster.

A Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht (HZG) marine X-band radar (MR) on board the R/V F. G. Walton Smith was used to locate fronts and eddies by their sea surface roughness signatures. The MR data were further processed to yield near-surface current maps at ~500-m resolution up to a maximum range of ~3 km. This study employs the drifter measurements to perform the first comprehensive validation of MR near-surface current maps.

The MR samples currents at a greater effective depth than the CARTHE drifters (1–5 m vs ~0.4 m). The mean MR–drifter differences are consistent with a wave- and wind-driven vertical current profile that weakens with increasing depth and rotates clockwise from the wind direction (by 0.7% of the wind speed and 15°).

FSLE fields computed from two-day model forecasts of the surface velocity indicate distinct regions of high relative drifter dispersion. Model predictions of such regions located on available ship-tracks were used to direct the launching of pairs of surface drifters on three days during March 2006, with the goal of maximizing coverage of the sampling area. For two of the three launches, the observed trajectories separated at locations and along directions closely approximated by those predicted from the model FSLE fields. The third case acted as an inadvertent control experiment. Model predictions at release-time showed minimal FSLE structure at the launch locations and the observed drifter pair advected in a coherent fashion for two days. While there are considerable differences between individual drifter observations and trajectory envelopes computed from ensembles of synthetic drifters, the experiment confirms the model's ability to approximate the location and shape of energetic flow features controlling the near-time fate of quasi-Lagrangian particles. Overall, the combined use of FSLEs with realistic coastal circulation models appears to be a promising avenue to aid real-time-directed drifter launches in observational programs.",2007-05-01,NA,Geophysical Research Letters,https://openalex.org/V36624081,Wiley,,NA,NA,NA,34,10,FALSE,38,,2007,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2164064777,,https://doi.org/10.1029/2007gl029634,journal-article,,,

A directed launch strategy, based on tracking the Lagrangian manifolds emanating from strongly hyperbolic regions in the flow field, is developed. In a series of twin assimilation experiments, the rate of convergence of the data assimilating scheme is shown to be consistently higher in such directed launches compared to those produced from randomly selected initial drifter positions. By directing initial drifter positions along the out-flowing branch of identifiable Lagrangian boundaries, the relative dispersion of the drifters, the overall data coverage and the sampling of high kinetic energy features in the flow are optimized.

Here, subsets of trajectories obtained from the near-simultaneous deployment of about 300 Coastal Ocean Dynamics Experiment (CODE) surface drifters provide both input and control data. The fidelity of surface velocity fields are measured in the Lagrangian frame by a skill score that compares the separation between observed and hindcast trajectories to the observed absolute dispersion. Trajectories estimated from altimetry-based velocities provide satisfactory average results (skill score &gt; 0.4) in large (~100 km) open-ocean structures. However, the distribution of skill score values within these structures is quite variable. In the DeSoto Canyon and on the shelf where smaller-scale structures are present, the overall altimeter skill score is typically reduced to less than 0.2. After 3 days, the dataset-averaged distance between hindcast and drifter trajectories, , is about 45 km—only slightly less than the average dispersion of the observations, km. Blending information from a subset of drifters via a variational method leads to significant improvements in all dynamical regimes. Skill scores typically increase to 0.8 with reduced to less than half of . Blending available drifter information with altimetry data restores velocity field variability at scales not directly sampled by the altimeter and introduces ageostrophic components that cannot be described by simple Ekman superposition.

These data are directly assimilated into the Navy Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM) four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR) analysis system in a series of experiments to investigate their impact on the model circulation. The NCOM-4DVAR is a newly developed tool for data analysis, formulated for weak-constraint data assimilation based on the indirect representer method. The assimilation experiments take advantage of this velocity data along with other available data sources from in situ and satellite measurements of surface and subsurface temperature and salinity. Three different experiments are done: (i) A nonassimilative NCOM free run, (ii) an assimilative NCOM run that utilizes temperature and salinity observations, and (iii) an assimilative NCOM run that uses temperature and salinity observations as well as the GLAD velocity observations. The resulting analyses and subsequent forecasts are compared to assimilated and future GLAD velocity and temperature/salinity observations to determine the performance of each experiment and the impact of the GLAD data on the analysis and the forecast. It is shown that the NCOM-4DVAR is able to fit the observations not only in the analysis step, but also in the subsequent forecast.

https://openalex.org/W2016500539,Reynolds number dependence of mixing in a lock-exchange system from direct numerical and large eddy simulations,,"Abstract Turbulent mixing of water masses of different temperatures and salinities is an important process for both coastal and large-scale ocean circulation. It is, however, difficult to capture computationally. One of the reasons is that mixing in the ocean occurs at a wide range of complexity, with the Reynolds number reaching Re = O ( 10 6 ) , or even higher. In this study, we continue to investigate whether large eddy simulation ( LES ) can be a reliable computational tool for stratified mixing in turbulent oceanic flows. LES is attractive because it can be O ( 1000 ) times faster than a direct numerical simulation ( DNS ) of stratified mixing in turbulent flows. Before using the LES methodology to compute mixing in realistic oceanic flows, however, a careful assessment of the LES sensitivity with respect to Re needs to be performed first. The main objectives of this study are: (i) to investigate the performance of different LES models at high Re, such as those encountered in oceanic flows; and (ii) to study how mixing varies as a function of Re. To this end, as a benchmark we use the lock-exchange problem, which is described by unambigous and simple initial and boundary conditions. The background potential energy, which accurately quantifies irreversible mixing in an enclosed system, is used as the main criterion in a posteriori testing of LES . This study has two main achievements. The first is that we investigate the accuracy of six combinations of two different classes of LES models, namely eddy-viscosity and approximate deconvolution types, for 3 × 10 3 ⩽ Re ⩽ 3 × 10 4 , for which DNS data is computed. We find that all LES models almost always provide significantly more accurate results than cases without LES models. Nevertheless, no single LES model that is persistently superior to others over this Re range could be identified. Then, an ensemble of the four best performing LES models is selected in order to estimate mixing taking place in this system at Re = 10 5 and 10 6 , for which DNS is presently not feasible. Thus the second achievement of this study is to quantify mixing taking place in this system over an Re range that changes by three orders of magnitude. We find that the background potential energy increases by about 67% when Re is increased from Re = 10 3 to Re = 10 6 , within the computation period, with the most significant increase taking place from Re = 3 × 10 3 to Re = 10 5 .",2009-01-01,NA,Ocean Modelling,https://openalex.org/V33756829,Elsevier,,NA,190,206,30,2-3,FALSE,34,,2009,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2016500539,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2009.06.013,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W2172736747,Lagrangian Data Assimilation in Multilayer Primitive Equation Ocean Models,,"Abstract Because of the increases in the realism of OGCMs and in the coverage of Lagrangian datasets in most of the world's oceans, assimilation of Lagrangian data in OGCMs emerges as a natural avenue to improve ocean state forecast with many potential practical applications, such as environmental pollutant transport, biological, and naval-related problems. In this study, a Lagrangian data assimilation method, which was introduced in prior studies in the context of single-layer quasigeostrophic and primitive equation models, is extended for use in multilayer OGCMs using statistical correlation coefficients between velocity fields in order to project the information from the data-containing layer to the other model layers. The efficiency of the assimilation scheme is tested using a set of twin experiments with a three-layer model, as a function of the layer in which the floats are launched and of the assimilation sampling period normalized by the Lagrangian time scale of motion. It is found that the assimilation scheme is effective provided that the correlation coefficient between the layer that contains the data and the others is high, and the data sampling period Δt is smaller than the Lagrangian time scale TL. When the assimilated data are taken in the first layer, which is the most energetic and is characterized by the fastest time scale, the assimilation is very efficient and gives relatively low errors also in the other layers (≈ 40% in the first 120 days) provided that Δt is small enough, Δt &amp;lt;&amp;lt; TL. The assimilation is also efficient for data released in the third layer (errors &amp;lt; 60%), while the dependence on Δt is distinctively less marked for the same range of values, since the time scales of the deeper layer are significantly longer. Results for the intermediate layer show a similar insensitivity to Δt, but the errors are higher (exceeding 70%), because of the lower correlation with the other layers. These results suggest that the assimilation of deep-layer data with low energetics can be very effective, but it is strongly dependent on layer correlation. The methodology also remains quite robust to large deviations from geostrophy.",2005-01-01,NA,Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology,https://openalex.org/V135937692,American Meteorological Society,,NA,70,83,22,1,FALSE,34,,2005,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2172736747,,https://doi.org/10.1175/jtech-1686.1,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W2129195715,Turbulent Mixing in the Red Sea Outflow Plume from a High-Resolution Nonhydrostatic Model,,"Abstract Given the motivation that overflow processes, which supply source waters for most of the deep and intermediate water masses in the ocean, pose significant numerical and dynamical challenges for ocean general circulation models, an intercomparison study is conducted between field data collected in the Red Sea overflow and a high-resolution, nonhydrostatic process model. The investigation is focused on the part of the outflow that flows along a long narrow channel, referred to as the “northern channel,” that naturally restricts motion in the lateral direction such that the use of a two-dimensional model provides a reasonable approximation to the dynamics. This channel carries about two-thirds of the total Red Sea overflow transport, after the overflow splits into two branches in the western Gulf of Aden. The evolution of the overflow in the numerical simulations can be characterized in two phases: the first phase is highly time dependent, during which the density front associated with the overflow propagates along the channel. The second phase corresponds to that of a statistically steady state. The primary accomplishment of this study is that the model adequately captures the general characteristics of the system: (i) the gradual thickening of the overflow with downstream distance, (ii) the advection of high salinity and temperature signals at the bottom along the channel with little dilution, and (iii) ambient water masses sandwiched between the overflow and surface mixed layer. To quantify mixing of the overflow with the ambient water masses, an entrainment parameter is determined from the transport increase along the slope and is expressed explicitly as a function of mean slope angle. Bulk Richardson numbers are estimated both from data and model and are related to the entrainment parameter. The range of entrainment parameter and its functional dependence on bulk Richardson number in this study are found to be in reasonable agreement with those reported from various laboratory experiments and that based on measurements of the Mediterranean overflow. The results reveal a complex dynamical interaction between shear-induced mixing and internal waves and illustrate the high computational and modeling requirements for numerical simulation of overflows to capture (at least in part) turbulent transports explicitly.",2003-08-01,NA,Journal of Physical Oceanography,https://openalex.org/V162372621,American Meteorological Society,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,31,,2003,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2129195715,,https://doi.org/10.1175/2401.1,journal-article,,,

We consider a steady barotropic current impinging on an obstacle in a rotating and linearly stratified environment. The obstacle is a triangular prism and represents an idealized headland extending from the coast. Numerical experiments are conducted at constant Rossby number Ro = 0.06 , varying the Burger number, Bu , and the obstacle slope, α . Flow regime diagrams in the Bu – α space are determined. For Bu < 0.1 , vertical movement over the obstacle is enhanced and a fully attached regime with pronounced internal waves is established. For 0.1 ⩽ Bu < 1 , fluid parcels flow more around the obstacle than over it. Flow separation occurs and small tip eddies start to shed. For Bu ⩾ 1 , tip eddies merge to form larger eddies in the lee of the cape. We find that previous laboratory results cannot be used for gentler slopes, since bottom flow regimes are strongly dependent on α when Bu ⩾ 1 . The form drag coefficient exerted by the cape is at least two orders of magnitude larger than the one due to skin friction. It increases with increasing Burger numbers and decreasing slopes. When no separation occurs (low Bu ), the increase with decreasing slopes is the result of the mixing associated with hydraulic phenomena. For intermediate and high Bu , form drag coefficients reach larger values as a result of the boundary layer mixing associated with flow separation. We put forth an empirical parametrization of form drag in the Bu – α space.",2008-01-01,NA,Ocean Modelling,https://openalex.org/V33756829,Elsevier,,NA,65,82,25,1-2,FALSE,30,,2008,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2163275467,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2008.06.006,journal-article,,,

Forecasting of the Lagrangian pathways necessarily relies on the accuracy of ocean and coastal models. However, these models include a number of errors that propagate directly from the Eulerian velocity field to the Lagrangian transport. In this study, so-called Lagrangian sub-grid-scale, or LSGS, model is developed to reduce errors projected to Lagrangian transport from errors arising from missing physics, uncertainties in forcing and unresolved scales in OGCMs. The LSGS method acts on the diagnostics of particle transport computed from coastal or ocean models, and it allows to minimize the discrepancy between the statistical behavior of the modeled (synthetic) and real (observed) trajectories. The method is shown to work well using both a so-called Markov velocity field model, representing an idealized turbulent flow field, and in the context of the Navy Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM) configured in the Adriatic Sea for realistic, highresolution, complex ocean flows.

We conduct a set of numerical experiments of the lock-exchange problem in the presence of lateral and vertical contractions. Large eddy simulations (LES) are carried out using the high-order nonhydrostatic spectral element model Nek5000. A spanwise-averaged 2D non-hydrostatic model, denoted SAM, is also employed. Comparison between 2D and 3D models are conducted on the basis of the shape of the density interface and the time evolution of the background potential energy that quantifies the cumulative effects of the stratified mixing in the system. LES indicates that an S-shaped channel induces the highest amount of mixing possibly due to the additional shears caused by the centrifugal force. Vertical and horizontal constrictions enhance mixing by the trapping and breaking of the internal waves in between the obstacles. On the other hand, vertical and horizontal constrictions overlapping with each other restrain the rate of the exchange flow, reduce vertical shears and the mixing. The lowest mixing is encountered in a W -shaped channel. It is also found that SAM appears to be accurate in identifying the hydraulic control points due to both horizontal and vertical constrictions. A good agreement is found between SAM and inviscid two-layer theory regarding the steady-state location of the density interface. However SAM overestimates mixing with respect to LES since overturning eddies tend to merge in 2D, while they break down into smaller scales in 3D. SAM is then further tested a realistic application to model the flow in the Bosphorus Strait. Here, the main challenges of using SAM revolved around a non-trivial reduction of 3D geometry to a 2D mapping function, and excessive diffusion with simple closures. The realism of SAM improves significantly using a comprehensive turbulence closure of Very Large Eddy Simulation, VLES. In conclusion, exchange flows in narrow straits pose significant computational challenges due to the details of domain geometry and their impact on mixing. SAM with the VLES turbulence closure appears to be an attractive modeling tool for a first-order assessment of dynamical problems involving mixing",2009-01-01,NA,Ocean Modelling,https://openalex.org/V33756829,Elsevier,,NA,159,175,29,3,FALSE,29,,2009,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2164714906,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2009.04.002,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W2527844710,Impact of submesoscales on surface material distribution in a gulf of Mexico mesoscale eddy,,"Abstract Understanding material distribution at the ocean’s surface is important for a number of applications, in particular for buoyant pollutants such as oil spills. The main tools to estimate surface flows are satellite altimeters, as well as data-assimilative ocean general circulation models (OGCMs). Current-generation altimeter products rely on the geostrophic approximation to derive surface currents. Recent modeling and experimental work revealed existence of ageostrophic submesoscale motions within the upper ocean boundary layer. The next frontier is how submesoscales influence transport pathways in the upper ocean, which is a multi-scale problem involving the interaction of submesoscale and mesoscale coherent structures. Here we focus on a mesoscale eddy that exhibits submesoscale fluctuations along its rim. The high-resolution OCGM fields are then treated with two filters. A Lanczos filter is applied to velocity fields to remove the kinetic energy over the submesoscales. Then a Gaussian filter is used for the modeled sea surface height to simulate a geostrophic velocity field that would be available from gridded satellite altimeter data. Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) are then generated from full-resolution and filtered fields to compare Lagrangian characteristics corresponding to different realizations of the surface velocity fields. It is found that while mesoscale currents exert a general control over the pathways of the tracer initially launched in the mesoscale eddy, there is a leak across the mesoscale transport barriers, induced by submesoscale motions. This leak is quantified as 20% of the tracer when using the submesoscale filter over one month of advection, while it increases to 50% using the geostrophic velocity field. We conclude that LCS computed from mesoscale surface velocity fields can be considered as a good first-order proxy, but the leakage of material across them in the presence of submesoscales can be significant.",2016-11-01,NA,Ocean Modelling,https://openalex.org/V33756829,Elsevier,,http://manuscript.elsevier.com/S1463500316301135/pdf/S1463500316301135.pdf,28,47,107,NA,TRUE,29,,2016,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2527844710,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2016.10.002,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W1970117540,"Numerical simulations of turbulent thermal, bubble and hybrid plumes",,"To understand the near-field dynamics of blowout plumes such as the one produced by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the effects of gas bubbles on turbulent mixing and entrainment are studied via turbulence resolving simulations. We compare the evolution of three plumes where extremely large buoyancy anomalies are produced either thermally (single phase), solely by an imposed gas phase volume fraction, or by a combination of both buoyancy forcings. The plumes, with identical volume, momentum and buoyancy fluxes at the inlet, are released into an environment stratified with a constant temperature gradient. To clarify the first-order effects of dynamically active, dispersed bubbles, we employ a simple model which neglects the momentum of the gas phase while retaining bubble induced buoyancy in the seawater momentum equation. The gas phase is then distinguished by a single, measurable parameter, the slip velocity relative to that of the liquid phase. We find that bubbles, parameterized simply by a constant slip velocity, without any explicit assumptions of direct bubble induced turbulent production, significantly increase turbulent mixing in the plume in agreement with previous experimental results. Examination of mean momenta and turbulent kinetic energy budgets shows that the increased turbulence is due to direct modification of the mean profiles of both the momentum and the active scalar fields by the slipping gas phase. The narrowing of the active scalar field in the two-phase flow results in larger direct buoyancy production of turbulent energy at all vertical levels. The turbulence production is, however, primarily mechanical. At modest values of z/D, where the slip velocity is only a small fraction of the liquid phase velocity, slip stretches the mean vertical velocity field producing larger radial gradients and increased conversion of mean to turbulent energy. This first order effect, acting on the mean vertical velocity component and not directly on the turbulence, implies that even relatively small gas volume fractions significantly enhance turbulent mixing with respect to a single phase plume.",2015-06-01,NA,Ocean Modelling,https://openalex.org/V33756829,Elsevier,,NA,16,28,90,NA,FALSE,28,,2015,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W1970117540,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2015.03.007,journal-article,,,

A technique known as Wheeler stretching was used to model the movement of particles under the moving water surface. In each simulation, 500 particles were released and were tracked for a real time of 4.0 h. A Monte Carlo approach was used to obtain ensemble properties. It was found that small eddy diffusivities that decrease rapidly with depth generated the largest horizontal spreading of the plume. It was also found that large eddy diffusivities that decrease slowly with depth generated the smallest horizontal spreading coefficient of the plume. The increase in buoyancy resulted in a decrease in the horizontal spreading coefficient, which suggests that two-dimensional (horizontal) models that predict the transport of surface oil could be overestimating the spreading of oil.",2016-03-15,NA,Marine Pollution Bulletin,https://openalex.org/V101229256,Elsevier,,NA,279,289,104,1-2,FALSE,27,,2016,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2234208716,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.01.007,journal-article,,,

https://openalex.org/W1992375046,Ocean current estimation using a Multi-Model Ensemble Kalman Filter during the Grand Lagrangian Deployment experiment (GLAD),,"Abstract In the summer and fall of 2012, during the GLAD experiment in the Gulf of Mexico, the Consortium for Advanced Research on Transport of Hydrocarbon in the Environment (CARTHE) used several ocean models to assist the deployment of more than 300 surface drifters. The Navy Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM) at 1 km and 3 km resolutions, the US Navy operational NCOM at 3 km resolution (AMSEAS), and two versions of the Hybrid Coordinates Ocean Model (HYCOM) set at 4 km were running daily and delivering 72-h range forecasts. They all assimilated remote sensing and local profile data but they were not assimilating the drifter’s observations. This work presents a non-intrusive methodology named Multi-Model Ensemble Kalman Filter that allows assimilating the local drifter data into such a set of models, to produce improved ocean currents forecasts. The filter is to be used when several modeling systems or ensembles are available and/or observations are not entirely handled by the operational data assimilation process. It allows using generic in situ measurements over short time windows to improve the predictability of local ocean dynamics and associated high-resolution parameters of interest for which a forward model exists (e.g. oil spill plumes). Results can be used for operational applications or to derive enhanced background fields for other data assimilation systems, thus providing an expedite method to non-intrusively assimilate local observations of variables with complex operators. Results for the GLAD experiment show the method can improve water velocity predictions along the observed drifter trajectories, hence enhancing the skills of the models to predict individual trajectories.",2015-03-01,NA,Ocean Modelling,https://openalex.org/V33756829,Elsevier,,NA,86,106,87,NA,FALSE,26,,2015,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W1992375046,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2014.11.001,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W2786112210,Drogue-Loss Detection for Surface Drifters during the Lagrangian Submesoscale Experiment (LASER),,"Abstract The Lagrangian Submesoscale Experiment (LASER) was designed to study surface flows during winter conditions in the northern Gulf of Mexico. More than 1000 mostly biodegradable drifters were launched. The drifters consisted of a surface floater extending 5 cm below the surface, containing the satellite tracking system, and a drogue extending 60 cm below the surface, hanging beneath the floater on a flexible tether. On some floats, the drogue separated from the floater during storms. This paper describes methods to detect drogue loss based on two properties that distinguish drogued from undrogued drifters. First, undrogued drifters often flip over, pointing their satellite antenna downward and thus intermittently reducing the frequency of GPS fixes. Second, undrogued drifters respond to wind forcing more than drogued drifters. A multistage analysis is used: first, two properties are used to create a preliminary drifter classification; then, the motion of each unclassified drifter is compared to that of its classified neighbors in an iterative process for nearly all of the drifters. The algorithm classified drifters with a known drogue status with an accuracy of virtually 100%. Drogue loss times were estimated with a precision of less than 0.5 and 3 h for 60% and 85% of the drifters, respectively. An estimated 40% of the drifters lost their drogues in the first 7 weeks, with drogue loss coinciding with storm events, particularly those with steep waves. Once the drogued and undrogued drifters are classified, they can be used to quantify the differences in material dispersion at different depths.",2018-03-28,NA,Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology,https://openalex.org/V135937692,American Meteorological Society,,https://doi.org/10.1175/jtech-d-17-0143.1,705,725,35,4,TRUE,26,,2018,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2786112210,,https://doi.org/10.1175/jtech-d-17-0143.1,journal-article,,,

Our ocean model is based upon the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) and includes the Richardson number–dependent entrainment parameterization of Xu et al. (2006). Given realistic topography and sufficient resolution, the model reproduces naturally the major, observed features of the Mediterranean outflow in the Gulf of Cadiz: the downstream evolution of temperature, salinity, and velocity profiles, the mean path and the spreading of the outflow plume, and most importantly, the localized, strong entrainment that has been observed to occur just west of the Strait of Gibraltar. As in all numerical solutions, there is some sensitivity to horizontal and vertical resolution. When the resolution is made coarser, the simulated currents are less vigorous and there is consequently less entrainment. Our Richardson number–dependent entrainment parameterization is therefore not recommended for direct application in coarse-resolution climate models. We have used the high-resolution regional model to investigate the response of the Mediterranean outflow to a change in the freshwater balance over the Mediterranean basin. The results are found in close agreement with the marginal sea boundary condition (MSBC): A more saline and dense Mediterranean deep water generates a significantly greater volume transport of the Mediterranean product water having only very slightly greater salinity.",2007-12-01,NA,Journal of Geophysical Research,https://openalex.org/V207178839,Wiley,,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2007JC004145,NA,NA,112,C12,TRUE,25,,2007,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2022133012,,https://doi.org/10.1029/2007jc004145,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W2128215424,Numerical investigation of the Sicily Channel dynamics: density currents and water mass advection,,"The Sicily Channel connects the western and eastern Mediterranean sub-basins, playing a fundamental role in the dynamics of the Mediterranean circulation. The flow in the Channel is driven by direct forcing such as wind and by thermohaline processes leading to density difference between the two sub-basins. Assessing the relative role of these two types of forcing mechanisms is still an open question in the literature, despite its importance for a correct understanding and prediction of the Channel circulation. In this paper, we isolate the remotely forced, density-driven component of the circulation, considering a simplified setting, where the forcing is schematized as an imposed density difference along the channel, Dq. The study is carried out considering results from a high resolution numerical model of the circulation in the Channel area. A range of values for Dq is considered, and the effects of changing Dq on the circulation patterns, transport values and water mass advection are studied. The patterns of the average circulation and water mass advection remain qualitatively similar at varying Dq. The simulations reproduce a number of realistic circulation features for both the surface Modified Atlantic Water (MAW) and the Levantine Intermediate Water (LIW). These include the complex branching patterns of the MAW at the entrance of the Channel, and the appearance of the characteristic structure of the Atlantic Ionian Stream (AIS) inside the Channel. At a more detailed level, the nonlinearity at increasing Dq appears to influence some aspects of the circulation, such as the relative strength of the Tyrrhenian and Sicilian MAW branches. The transport across the Channel is found to increase approximately linearly with Dq in the considered range, with values ranging from c0.3 to c0.8 Sv. The lowest value corresponds to Dq based on climatological density value in the neighbouring regions (Sardinia Channel and Ionian Sea), while the highest values correspond to more remote density values, i.e. to differences between the far-field western and eastern Mediterranean sub-basins.

Two regimes are found in which Fofonoff-like circulations emerge as a direct consequence of the baroclinic nature of the system, since the wind forcing used in these experiments has been shown to inhibit the formation of Fofonoff flows in the barotropic case. The first regime is one in which the magnitudes of the frictional coefficients (viscosity and bottom dissipation) are extremely small. The experiments clearly illustrate the transition of the numerical solution from a conventional wind-driven circulation to an inertial Fofonoff-like regime. The latter circulation first appears in the lower layer and then spreads throughout the water column via barotropization. The second regime, surprisingly, is obtained with very high bottom friction. This result indicates that entropy can be maximized independently in each layer, depending on the distribution of forcing and dissipation. This sheds a new perspective on the common assumption that forcing and dissipation are disruptive effects that prevent the system from displaying a Fofonoff state.",1998-03-01,NA,Journal of Physical Oceanography,https://openalex.org/V162372621,American Meteorological Society,,https://journals.ametsoc.org/downloadpdf/journals/phoc/28/3/1520-0485_1998_028_0461_eoigia_2.0.co_2.pdf,461,484,28,3,TRUE,24,,1998,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2161209320,,https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0485(1998)028<0461:eoigia>2.0.co;2,journal-article,,,

We use analytical and numerical model results to assess the potential impact of these corrugations on outflows of dense shelf water that contribute to Antarctic Bottom Water. Down-slope flow increases with increasing corrugation height and varies with along-slope wavelength. For parameters appropriate to the northwest Ross Sea, where heights and wavelengths are ∼10―20 m and ∼1.5 km, respectively, we estimate that the corrugations increase the down-slope transport of dense water, relative to the smooth bottom case, by ∼13%. Corrugations enhance entrainment and reduce along-slope speed of the dense outflow. Larger amplitude corrugations (∼100 m) observed in other regions may impact outflows elsewhere around the poorly mapped Antarctic continental margin.

Results at three different horizontal model resolutions are compared to each other, to recent hydrographic sections and moored observations. Simulations in the finest grid employed, 1/12° resolution, show realistic overflow pathways, reasonable overflow and Deep Western Boundary Current mean velocities and transports, and overall reasonable North Atlantic three-dimensional temperature and salinity fields, namely the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). In contrast, simulations at coarser grids of 1/3° and 1° resolution exhibit a range of significant problems owing to unresolved, dynamically vital features in the seafloor topography. This lack of resolution, for example of the Faroe Bank Channel, leads to unrealistic overflow pathways between Iceland and Scotland in the 1/3° and 1° cases. Accordingly, overflow mass transports are also unrealistic in this area. In the Denmark Strait Overflow the underlying topographical scales are larger, and pathways are reasonable even at coarse resolution. However, overflow speeds are too small in the 1/3° and 1° cases. Underestimated velocities in the 1° simulations are compensated by an overestimated sill cross-section, whereas it is too small in 1/3°. As such, the 1/3° and 1° simulations show both large under- and overestimations of volume transport at several locations. No significant improvement in modeled overflows takes place when the grid spacing is decreased from 1° to 1/3°. An experiment conducted with hand-tuned topography shows improved volume transports near the regions of modification, but somewhat increased errors in other parts of the deep circulation, indicating the complex response of the system to perturbations in bathymetry.

https://openalex.org/W2432841393,Effects of rotation on turbulent buoyant plumes in stratified environments,,"We numerically investigate the effects of rotation on the turbulent dynamics of thermally driven buoyant plumes in stratified environments at the large Rossby numbers characteristic of deep oceanic releases. When compared to nonrotating environments, rotating plumes are distinguished by a significant decrease in vertical buoyancy and momentum fluxes leading to lower and thicker neutrally buoyant intrusion layers. The primary dynamic effect of background rotation is the concentration of entraining fluid into a strong cyclonic flow at the base of the plume resulting in cyclogeostrophic balance in the radial momentum equation. The structure of this cyclogeostrophic balance moving upward from the well head is associated with a net adverse vertical pressure gradient producing an inverted hydrostatic balance in the mean vertical momentum budgets. The present simulations reveal that the primary response to the adverse pressure gradient is an off-axis deflection of the plume that evolves into a robust, organized anticyclonic radial precession about the buoyancy source. The off-axis evolution is responsible for the weaker inertial overshoots, the increased thickness of lateral intrusion layers, and the overall decrease in the vertical extent of rotating plumes at intermediate Rossby numbers compared to the nonrotating case. For inlet buoyancy forcings and environmental Rossby numbers consistent with those expected in deepwater blowout plumes, the speed of the organized precession is found to be as large as typical oceanic cross-flow speeds.",2016-08-01,NA,Journal Of Geophysical Research: Oceans,https://openalex.org/V4210200322,Wiley,,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/2016JC011737,5397,5417,121,8,TRUE,22,,2016,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2432841393,,https://doi.org/10.1002/2016jc011737,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W2167520009,"Chaotic advection in a steady, three-dimensional, Ekman-driven eddy",,"Abstract We investigate and quantify stirring due to chaotic advection within a steady, three-dimensional, Ekman-driven, rotating cylinder flow. The flow field has vertical overturning and horizontal swirling motion, and is an idealization of motion observed in some ocean eddies. The flow is characterized by strong background rotation, and we explore variations in Ekman and Rossby numbers, $E$ and ${R}_{o} $ , over ranges appropriate for the ocean mesoscale and submesoscale. A high-resolution spectral element model is used in conjunction with linear analytical theory, weakly nonlinear resonance analysis and a kinematic model in order to map out the barriers, manifolds, resonance layers and other objects that provide a template for chaotic stirring. As expected, chaos arises when a radially symmetric background state is perturbed by a symmetry-breaking disturbance. In the background state, each trajectory lives on a torus and some of the latter survive the perturbation and act as barriers to chaotic transport, a result consistent with an extension of the KAM theorem for three-dimensional, volume-preserving flow. For shallow eddies, where $E$ is $O(1)$ , the flow is dominated by thin resonant layers sandwiched between KAM-type barriers, and the stirring rate is weak. On the other hand, eddies with moderately small $E$ experience thicker resonant layers, wider-spread chaos and much more rapid stirring. This trend reverses for sufficiently small $E$ , corresponding to deep eddies, where the vertical rigidity imposed by strong rotation limits the stirring. The bulk stirring rate, estimated from a passive tracer release, confirms the non-monotonic variation in stirring rate with $E$ . This result is shown to be consistent with linear Ekman layer theory in conjunction with a resonant width calculation and the Taylor–Proudman theorem. The theory is able to roughly predict the value of $E$ at which stirring is maximum. For large disturbances, the stirring rate becomes monotonic over the range of Ekman numbers explored.

https://openalex.org/W2276364972,On the nature of the frontal zone of the Choctawhatchee Bay plume in the Gulf of Mexico,,"River plumes often feature turbulent processes in the frontal zone and interfacial region at base of the plume, which ultimately impact spreading and mixing rates with the ambient coastal ocean. The degree to which these processes govern overall plume mixing is yet to be quantified with microstructure observations. A field campaign was conducted in a river plume in the northeast Gulf of Mexico in December 2013, in order to assess mixing processes that could potentially impact transport and dispersion of surface material near coastal regions. Current velocity, density, and Turbulent Kinetic Energy Values, e, were obtained using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), a Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD) profiler, a Vertical Microstructure Profiler (VMP), and two Acoustic Doppler Velocimeters (ADVs). The frontal region contained e values on the order of 10−5 m2 s−3, which were markedly larger than in the ambient water beneath (O 10−9 m2 s−3). An energetic wake of moderate e values (O 10−6 m2 s−3) was observed trailing the frontal edge. The interfacial region of an interior section of the plume featured opposing horizontal velocities and a e value on the order of 10−6 m2 s−3. A simplified mixing budget was used under significant assumptions to compare contributions from wind, tides, and frontal regions of the plume. The results from this order of magnitude analysis indicated that frontal processes (59%) dominated in overall mixing. This emphasizes the importance of adequate parameterization of river plume frontal processes in coastal predictive models.",2016-02-01,NA,Journal Of Geophysical Research: Oceans,https://openalex.org/V4210200322,Wiley,,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/2015JC010988,1322,1345,121,2,TRUE,21,,2016,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2276364972,,https://doi.org/10.1002/2015jc010988,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W2293073011,Simulation of oil bioremediation in a tidally influenced beach: Spatiotemporal evolution of nutrient and dissolved oxygen,,"Numerical experiments of oil bioremediation of tidally influenced beach were simulated using the model BIOMARUN. Nutrient and dissolved oxygen were assumed present in a solution applied on the exposed beach face, and the concentration of these amendments was tracked throughout the beach for up to 6 months. It was found that, in comparison to natural attenuation, bioremediation increased the removal efficiency by 76% and 65% for alkanes and aromatics, respectively. Increasing the nutrient concentration in the applied solution did not always enhance biodegradation as oxygen became limiting even when the beach was originally oxygen-rich. Therefore, replenishment of oxygen to oil-contaminated zone was also essential. Stimulation of oil biodegradation was more evident in the upper and midintertidal zone of the beach, and less in the lower intertidal zone. This was due to reduced nutrient and oxygen replenishment, as very little of the amendment solution reached that zone. It was found that under continual application, most of the oil biodegraded within 2 months, while it persisted for 6 months under natural conditions. While the difference in duration suggests minimal long-term effects, there are situations where the beach would need to be cleaned for major ecological functions, such as temporary nesting or feeding for migratory birds. Biochemical retention time map (BRTM) showed that the duration of solution application was dependent upon the stimulated oil biodegradation rate. By contrast, the application rate of the amendment solution was dependent upon the subsurface extent of the oil-contaminated zone. Delivery of nutrient and oxygen into coastal beach involved complex interaction among amendment solution, groundwater, and seawater. Therefore, approaches that ignore the hydrodynamics due to tide are unlikely to provide the optimal solutions for shoreline bioremediation.",2016-04-01,NA,Journal Of Geophysical Research: Oceans,https://openalex.org/V4210200322,Wiley,,https://doi.org/10.1002/2015jc011221,2385,2404,121,4,TRUE,21,,2016,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2293073011,,https://doi.org/10.1002/2015jc011221,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W2054585927,How Does Drifter Position Uncertainty Affect Ocean Dispersion Estimates?,,"Abstract To develop methodologies to maximize the information content of Lagrangian data subject to position errors, synthetic trajectories produced by both a large-eddy simulation (LES) of an idealized submesoscale flow field and a high-resolution Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model simulation of the North Atlantic circulation are analyzed. Scale-dependent Lagrangian measures of two-particle dispersion, mainly the finite-scale Lyapunov exponent [FSLE; λ ( δ )], are used as metrics to determine the effects of position uncertainty on the observed dispersion regimes. It is found that the cumulative effect of position uncertainty on λ ( δ ) may extend to scales 20–60 times larger than the position uncertainty. The range of separation scales affected by a given level of position uncertainty depends upon the slope of the true FSLE distribution at the scale of the uncertainty. Low-pass filtering or temporal subsampling of the trajectories reduces the effective noise amplitudes at the smallest spatial scales at the expense of limiting the maximum computable value of λ . An adaptive time-filtering approach is proposed as a means of extracting the true FSLE signal from data with uncertain position measurements. Application of this filtering process to the drifters with the Argos positioning system released during the LatMix: Studies of Submesoscale Stirring and Mixing (2011) indicates that the measurement noise dominates the dispersion regime in λ for separation scales δ &lt; 3 km. An expression is provided to estimate position errors that can be afforded depending on the expected maximum λ in the submesoscale regime.",2014-12-15,NA,Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology,https://openalex.org/V135937692,American Meteorological Society,,NA,2809,2828,31,12,FALSE,20,,2014,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2054585927,,https://doi.org/10.1175/jtech-d-14-00107.1,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W2525763258,Dynamics of multiphase turbulent plumes with hybrid buoyancy sources in stratified environments,,"Deepwater oil blowouts typically generate multiphase hybrid plumes where the total inlet buoyancy flux is set by the combined presence of gas, oil, and heat. We numerically investigate the effects of combined sources of inlet buoyancy on turbulent plume dynamics by varying the inputs of a dispersed, slipping gas phase and a non-slipping buoyant liquid phase in thermally stratified environments. The ability of a single momentum equation, multiphase model to correctly reproduce characteristic plume heights is validated for both dispersed liquid phase and pure gas bubble plumes. A hybrid case, containing buoyancy contributions from both gas and liquid phases, is also investigated. As expected, on the plume centerline, the presence of a slipping gas phase increases both the vertical location of the neutrally buoyant equilibrium height and the maximum vertical extent of the liquid effluent relative to non-bubble plumes. While producing an overall increase in the plume height, the presence of a slipping gas phase also significantly enhances both the extent and magnitude of negatively buoyant downdrafts in the outer plume region. As a result, the intrusion or trapping height, the vertical distance where liquid phase plume effluent accumulates, is found to be significantly lower in both bubble and hybrid plumes. Below the intrusion level, the simulations are compared to an integral model formulation that explicitly accounts for the effects of the gas slip velocity in the evolution of the buoyancy flux. Discrepancies in the integral model and full solutions are largest in the source vicinity region where vertical turbulent volume fluxes, necessarily neglected in the integral formulation, are significant.",2016-09-28,NA,Physics of Fluids,https://openalex.org/V22862804,American Institute of Physics,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,20,,2016,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2525763258,,https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4963313,journal-article,,,

Histograms of the velocity field and its statistical parameters are non-Gaussian; most are multimodal. The dominant periods for the surface velocity field are 1–2 days due to inertial oscillations, tides, and the sea breeze; 5–6 days due to wind forcing and submesoscale eddies; 9–10 days and two weeks or longer periods due to wind forcing and mesoscale variability, including the period of eddy rotation. The temporal e-folding scales of a fitted drifter velocity autocorrelation function are bimodal with time scales, 0.25–0.50 days and 0.9–1.4 days, and are the same order as the temporal e-folding scales of observed winds from nearby moored National Data Buoy Center stations. The Lagrangian integral time scales increase from coastal values of 8 h to offshore values of approximately 2 days with peak values of 3–4 days. The velocity variance is large, O(1)m2/s2, the surface velocity statistics are more anisotropic, and increased dispersion is observed at flow bifurcations.

https://openalex.org/W2163216484,Numerical Simulation of the Red Sea Outflow Using HYCOM and Comparison with REDSOX Observations,,"Abstract The outflow of warm, salty, and dense water from the Red Sea into the western Gulf of Aden is numerically simulated using the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). The pathways of the modeled overflow, temperature, salinity, velocity profiles from stations and across sections, and transport estimates are compared to those observed during the 2001 Red Sea Outflow Experiment. As in nature, the simulated outflow is funneled into two narrow channels along the seafloor. The results from the three-dimensional simulations show a favorable agreement with the observed temperature and salinity profiles along the channels. The volume transport of the modeled overflow increases with the increasing distance from the southern exit of the Bab el Mandeb Strait due to entrainment of ambient fluid, such that the modeled transport shows a reasonable agreement with that estimated from the observations. The initial propagation speed of the outflow is found to be smaller than the estimated interfacial wave speed. The slow propagation is shown to result from the roughness of the bottom topography characterized by a number of depressions that take time to be filled with outflow water. Sensitivities of the results to the horizontal grid spacing, different entrainment parameterizations, and forcing at the source location are investigated. Because of the narrow widths of the approximately 5 km of the outflow channels, a horizontal grid spacing of 1 km or less is required for model simulations to achieve a reasonable agreement with the observations. Comparison of two entrainment parameterizations, namely, TPX and K-profile parameterization (KPP), show that similar results are obtained at 1-km resolution. Overall, the simulation of the Red Sea outflow appears to be more strongly affected by the details of bottom topography and grid spacing needed to adequately resolve them than by parameterizations of diapycnal mixing.",2008-02-01,NA,Journal of Physical Oceanography,https://openalex.org/V162372621,American Meteorological Society,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,18,,2008,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2163216484,,https://doi.org/10.1175/2007jpo3697.1,journal-article,,,

https://openalex.org/W2606359449,Passive Optical Sensing of the Near-Surface Wind-Driven Current Profile,,"Abstract Estimation of near-surface current is essential to the estimation of upper-ocean material transport. Wind forcing and wave motions are dominant in the near-surface layer [within O (0.01) m of the surface], where the highly sheared flows can differ greatly from those at depth. This study presents a new method for remotely measuring the directional wind and wave drift current profile near to the surface (between 0.01 and 0.001 m for the laboratory and between 0.1 and 0.001 m for the field). This work follows the spectral analysis of high spatial ( 0.002 m) and temporal resolution ( 60 Hz) wave slope images, allowing for the evaluation of near-surface current characteristics without having to rely on instruments that may disturb the flow. Observations gathered in the 15 m × 1 m × 1 m wind-wave flume at the University of Miami’s Surge-Structure-Atmosphere Interaction (SUSTAIN) facility show that currents retrieved via this method agree well with the drift velocity of camera-tracked dye. Application of this method to data collected in the mouth of the Columbia River (MCR) indicates the presence of a near-surface current component that departs considerably from the tidal flow and may be steered by the wind stress. These observations demonstrate that wind speed–based parameterizations alone may not be sufficient to estimate wind drift and to hold implications for the way in which surface material (e.g., debris or spilled oil) transport is estimated when atmospheric stress is of relatively high magnitude or is steered off the mean wind direction.",2017-05-11,NA,Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology,https://openalex.org/V135937692,American Meteorological Society,,NA,1097,1111,34,5,FALSE,18,,2017,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2606359449,,https://doi.org/10.1175/jtech-d-16-0090.1,journal-article,,,

In particular, the Lagrangian geometry changes near the resonant tori of the unforced flow, whose frequencies are rationally related to the forcing frequencies. Multi-scale analytical expansions are used to simplify the flow in the vicinity of resonant trajectories and to investigate the resonant flow geometries. The resonance condition and scaling can be motivated by simple physical argument. The theoretically predicted flow geometries near resonant trajectories have then been confirmed through numerical simulations in a phenomenological model and in a full solution of the Navier-Stokes equations.",2015-03-30,NA,Chaos,https://openalex.org/V187806540,American Institute of Physics,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,17,,2015,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W1998013993,,https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4916086,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W2194410998,Material transport in a convective surface mixed layer under weak wind forcing,,"Abstract Flows in the upper ocean mixed layer are responsible for the transport and dispersion of biogeochemical tracers, phytoplankton and buoyant pollutants, such as hydrocarbons from an oil spill. Material dispersion in mixed layer flows subject to diurnal buoyancy forcing and weak winds ( | u 10 | = 5 m s − 1 ) are investigated using a non-hydrostatic model. Both purely buoyancy-forced and combined wind- and buoyancy-forced flows are sampled using passive tracers, as well as 2D and 3D particles to explore characteristics of horizontal and vertical dispersion. It is found that the surface tracer patterns are determined by the convergence zones created by convection cells within a time scale of just a few hours. For pure convection, the results displayed the classic signature of Rayleigh–Benard cells. When combined with a wind stress, the convective cells become anisotropic in that the along-wind length scale gets much larger than the cross-wind scale. Horizontal relative dispersion computed by sampling the flow fields using both 2D and 3D passive particles is found to be consistent with the Richardson regime. Relative dispersion is an order of magnitude higher and 2D surface releases transition to Richardson regime faster in the wind-forced case. We also show that the buoyancy-forced case results in significantly lower amplitudes of scale-dependent horizontal relative diffusivity, k D (l), than those reported by Okubo (1970), while the wind- and buoyancy-forced case shows a good agreement with Okubo’s diffusivity amplitude, and the scaling is consistent with Richardson’s 4/3rd law, k D ∼ l 4/3 .

We conducted a rapid-response sampling campaign near Hercules 265 after the fire to ascertain if sediments and fishes were polluted above earlier baseline levels. A surface drifter study confirmed that surface ocean water flowed to the southeast of the Hercules site, while the atmospheric plume generated by the blowout was in eastward direction. Sediment cores were collected to the SE of the rig at a distance of ∼0.2, 8, and 18 km using a multicorer, and demersal fishes were collected from ∼0.2 to 8 km SE of the rig using a longline (508 hooks). Recently deposited sediments document that only high molecular weight (HMW) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations decreased with increasing distance from the rig suggesting higher pyrogenic inputs associated with the blowout. A similar trend was observed in the foraminifera Haynesina germanica, an indicator species of pollution. In red snapper bile, only HMW PAH metabolites increased in 2013 nearly double those from 2012.

This paper presents the application of a shipboard wave-sensing method toward the following quantifications: regime-specific contribution to sea surface slope and sensitivity to wind speed increases. Measurements were made via polarimetric camera, resolving waves with wavelengths ranging from 0.21 to 0.003 m (30 rad/m < k < 1750 rad/m). The gravity-capillary regime was found to contribute the bulk of mean square slope during stationary wind conditions and supply the majority of mean square slope growth during periods of increasing wind speed. Capillary waves were found to contribute approximately 5% of the overall surface roughness. Furthermore, capillary waves were found to be the least sensitive to increases in wind speed. This implies that such waves saturate at low wind speeds ( ≈ 3 m/s) and slow wind speed increases ( ≈ 0.02 m/s2).

Modeling approaches that have been tested so far rely either on algebraic parameterizations in hydrostatic ocean circulation models, or on large eddy simulations that resolve most of the mixing using nonhydrostatic models. In this study, we examine the performance of a set of turbulence closures, that have not been tested in comparison to observational data for overflows before. We employ the so-called very large eddy simulation (VLES) technique, which allows the use of k – ε models in nonhydrostatic models. This is done by applying a dynamic spatial filtering to the k – ε equations. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the VLES approach is adopted for an ocean modeling problem. The performance of k – ε and VLES models are evaluated by conducting numerical simulations of the Red Sea overflow and comparing them to observations from the Red Sea Outflow Experiment (REDSOX). The computations are constrained to one of the main channels transporting the overflow, which is narrow enough to permit the use of a two-dimensional (and nonhydrostatic) model. A large set of experiments are conducted using different closure models, Reynolds numbers and spatial resolutions. It is found that, when no turbulence closure is used, the basic structure of the overflow, consisting of a well-mixed bottom layer (BL) and entraining interfacial layer (IL), cannot be reproduced. The k – ε model leads to unrealistic thicknesses for both BL and IL, while VLES results in the most realistic reproduction of the REDSOX observations.",2008-01-01,NA,Ocean Modelling,https://openalex.org/V33756829,Elsevier,,NA,183,206,20,2,FALSE,14,,2008,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W1992833086,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2007.08.002,journal-article,,,

Here, we estimate the submesoscale velocity field sampled by those drifters using a procedure that statistically interpolates these data both spatially and temporally. Because the spacing of the drifters evolves with the flow, causing the resolution that they provide to vary in space and time, it is important to be able to characterize where and when the estimated velocity field is more or less accurate, which we do by providing fields of interpolation errors. Our interpolation uses a squared-exponential covariance function characterizing correlations in latitude, longitude, and time. Two novelties in our approach are 1) the use of two scales of variation per dimension in the covariance function and 2) allowing the data to determine these scales along with the appropriate amplitude of observational noise at these scales. We present the evolution of the reconstructed velocity field along with maps of relative vorticity, horizontal divergence, and lateral strain rate. The reconstructed velocity field exhibits horizontal length scales of 0.4–3.5 km and time scales of 0.6–3 h, and features with convergence up to 8 times the planetary vorticity f , lateral strain rate up to 10 f , and relative vorticity up to 13 f .

https://openalex.org/W3136277259,Frontal Convergence and Vertical Velocity Measured by Drifters in the Alboran Sea,,"Horizontal and vertical motions associated with mesoscale (10–100 km) and submesoscale (1–10 km) features, such as fronts, meanders, eddies, and filaments, play a critical role in redistributing physical and biogeochemical properties in the ocean. This study makes use of a multiplatform data set of 82 drifters, a Lagrangian float, and profile timeseries of temperature and salinity, obtained in a ∼1-m/s semipermanent frontal jet in the Alboran Sea as part of CALYPSO (Coherent Lagrangian Pathways from the Surface Ocean to Interior). Drifters drogued at ∼1-m and 15-m depth capture the mesoscale and submesoscale circulation aligning along the perimeter of fronts due to horizontal shear. Clusters of drifters are used to estimate the kinematic properties, such as vorticity and divergence, of the flow by fitting a bivariate plane to the horizontal drifter velocities. Clusters with submesoscale length scales indicate normalized vorticity ζ/f > 1 with Coriolis frequency f and normalized divergence of (1) occurring in patches along the front, with error variance around 10%. By computing divergence from drifter clusters at two different depths, we estimate minimum vertical velocity of (−100 m day−1) in the upper 10 m of the water column. These results are at least twice as large as previous estimates of vertical velocity in the region. Location, magnitude, and timing of the convergence are consistent with behavior of a Lagrangian float subducting in the center of a drifter cluster.

Idealized models show that wave frequency depends on the amount of stretching in the ambient fluid over the outflow and on background along-slope mean flow. Frequency is higher for steeper bottom slope, larger outflow density anomaly, and stronger westward mean flow. For weak stratification and weak westward along-slope flows typical of the Antarctic slope, wave energy propagates eastward, in the opposite direction from phase velocity. Our results are consistent with recent observations of TVWs in the southern Weddell Sea. In a realistic simulation of the Ross Sea, TVW properties are modulated on seasonal and shorter time scales as background ocean state varies.

https://openalex.org/W1987682967,How does the Red Sea outflow water interact with Gulf of Aden Eddies?,,"Abstract As the Red Sea overflow water (RSOW) enters the Gulf of Aden (GOA), it interacts with a sequence of nearly barotropic, mesoscale eddies originating in the Indian Ocean. To investigate how these eddies impact the dispersal and eastward transport of the RSOW toward the Indian Ocean, a high resolution 3D regional model is employed to explore systematically the interaction between the RSOW and mesoscale eddies. Two types of experiments are conducted. In the first set, we simulate the behavior of RSOW in the presence of an idealized cyclone and an idealized anticyclone. The second type of simulation involves nesting of the regional model (ROMS) within a data-assimilating global model (HYCOM), in which a sequence of mesoscale eddies entering the Gulf of Aden is realistically captured. This simulation is integrated for one year, and includes a simple representation of the seasonality of the RSOW. Bower et al. (2002) suggest that the Red Sea overflow might be a western boundary undercurrent. Consistent with these expectations, the idealized simulations show that the preferred pathway of the RSOW in the absence of eddies is along the coast of Somalia (southern continental shelf) as a western boundary undercurrent. Simultaneously, a cyclonic circulation is generated in the far western GOA due to vortex stretching by the descending outflow. The presence of a cyclone in the western GOA increases the peak RSOW transport, but the cyclone itself rapidly loses its coherence after interacting with the rough topography in the western GOA. The presence of an anticyclone tends to block the preferred boundary pathway and inhibits the eastward transport of the RSOW. The eddies also result in substantially increased mixing of the RSOW in the western GOA. On the basis of the more realistic ROMS experiment, it is found that the modeled RSOW leaves the western part of the Gulf of Aden in short episodic bursts with transports that are an order of magnitude greater than that associated with the quasi-steady RSOW inflow into GOA. Such enhancement in RSOW transport is shown to be induced by cyclonic eddies that cause a rapid discharge of RSOW from the western part of the GOA. We conclude that mesoscale eddies play a key role in the transport and mixing of the RSOW within GOA.",2011-01-01,NA,Ocean Modelling,https://openalex.org/V33756829,Elsevier,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,12,,2011,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W1987682967,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2010.10.006,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W2003797778,Stochastic boundary conditions for coastal flow modeling,,[1] Recent high-resolution radar data of surface velocity between the Florida Current and the coast allow us for the first time to deduce coastal boundary conditions for ocean models based on observations. A stochastic model is found to be a better choice for simulating properties of the observed vorticity than a model with deterministic boundary conditions. A stochastic model parameterizing boundary conditions is developed and embedded in a simple quasigeostrophic ocean model. Comparison of numerical simulations of western boundary flow with stochastic boundary conditions against simulations with traditional no-slip and free-slip conditions reveals significant differences in the formation of coherent mesoscale structures and the energetics of the western boundary current. Coherent structures such as dipoles and submesoscale vortices can be generated using stochastic boundary conditions. The boundary current variability becomes more energetic and “episodic” than quasi-periodic circulation features in the simulations using the conventional boundary conditions.,2003-05-01,NA,Geophysical Research Letters,https://openalex.org/V36624081,Wiley,,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2003GL016972,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,11,,2003,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2003797778,,https://doi.org/10.1029/2003gl016972,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W2344940770,Surface dynamics of crude and weathered oil in the presence of dispersants: Laboratory experiment and numerical simulation,,"Marine oil spills can have dire consequences for the environment. Research on their dynamics is important for the well-being of coastal communities and their economies. Propagation of oil spills is a very complex physical-chemical process. As seen during the Deepwater Horizon event in the Gulf of Mexico during 2010, one of the critical problems remaining for prediction of oil transport and dispersion in the marine environment is the small-scale structure and dynamics of surface oil spills. The laboratory experiments conducted in this work were focused on understanding the differences between the dynamics of crude and weathered oil spills and the effect of dispersants. After deposition on the still water surface, a drop of crude oil quickly spread into a thin slick; while at the same time, a drop of machine (proxy for weathered) oil did not show significant evolution. Subsequent application of dispersant to the crude oil slick resulted in a quick contraction or fragmentation of the slick into narrow wedges and tiny drops. Notably, the slick of machine oil did not show significant change in size or topology after spraying dispersant. An advanced multi-phase, volume of fluid computational fluid dynamics model, incorporating capillary forces, was able to explain some of the features observed in the laboratory experiment. As a result of the laboratory and modeling experiments, the new interpretation of the effect of dispersant on the oil dispersion process including capillary effects has been proposed, which is expected to lead to improved oil spill models and response strategies.",2016-05-01,NA,Journal Of Geophysical Research: Oceans,https://openalex.org/V4210200322,Wiley,,https://doi.org/10.1002/2015jc011533,3502,3516,121,5,TRUE,11,,2016,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2344940770,,https://doi.org/10.1002/2015jc011533,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W2977637351,Small-Scale Dispersion in the Presence of Langmuir Circulation,,"Abstract We present an analysis of ocean surface dispersion characteristics, on 1–100-m scales, obtained by optically tracking a release of bamboo plates for 2 h in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Under sustained 5–6 m s −1 winds, energetic Langmuir cells are clearly delineated in the spatially dense plate observations. Within 10 min of release, the plates collect in windrows with 15-m spacing aligned with the wind. Windrow spacing grows, through windrow merger, to 40 m after 20 min and then expands at a slower rate to 50 m. The presence of Langmuir cells produces strong horizontal anisotropy and scale dependence in all surface dispersion statistics computed from the plate observations. Relative dispersion in the crosswind direction initially dominates but eventually saturates, while downwind dispersion exhibits continual growth consistent with contributions from both turbulent fluctuations and organized mean shear. Longitudinal velocity differences in the crosswind direction indicate mean convergence at scales below the Langmuir cell diameter and mean divergence at larger scales. Although the second-order structure function measured by contemporaneous GPS-tracked surface drifters drogued at ~0.5 m shows persistent r 2/3 power law scaling down to 100–200-m separation scales, the second-order structure function for the very near surface plates observations has considerably higher energy and significantly shallower slope at scales below 100 m. This is consistent with contemporaneous data from undrogued surface drifters and previously published model results indicating shallowing spectra in the presence of direct wind-wave forcing mechanisms.",2019-12-03,NA,Journal of Physical Oceanography,https://openalex.org/V162372621,American Meteorological Society,,https://journals.ametsoc.org/downloadpdf/journals/phoc/49/12/jpo-d-19-0107.1.pdf,3069,3085,49,12,TRUE,11,,2019,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2977637351,,https://doi.org/10.1175/jpo-d-19-0107.1,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W2088151578,Enhanced estimation of sonobuoy trajectories by velocity reconstruction with near-surface drifters,,"Abstract An investigation to improve trajectory prediction using Lagrangian data is presented. The velocity field of a data assimilating model, EAS-16, is corrected using drifter observations taken during an experiment off Taiwan. The results are tested using another independent Lagrangian data set provided by sonobuoys launched in the same area. The latter have instrument chains that extend well into the water column. Consequently the corrected model velocities were projected into the water column in order to calculate sonobuoy trajectories. The drifter and sonobuoy trajectories both show two distinct regimes in the considered area of approximately 1/2° square. One regime is dominated by shelf dynamics, the other by meandering of the Kuroshio, with a sharp boundary dividing the two. These two regimes are not reproduced by the trajectories of the EAS-16 model. When the drifter data are blended with the model velocities, synthetic sonobuoy trajectories track the observed ones much better, and the two regimes are clearly depicted. Two different methods for the velocity reconstruction are tested. One is based on a variational approach and the other on a normal mode decomposition. Both methods show qualitatively similar improvements in the prediction of sonobuoys trajectories, with a quantitative improvement in the total rms error of approximately 50% and 25%, respectively.",2011-01-01,NA,Ocean Modelling,https://openalex.org/V33756829,Elsevier,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,10,,2011,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2088151578,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2010.11.002,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W2117327182,Investigating transport pathways in the ocean,,"The ocean is a very complex medium with scales of motion that range from thousands of kilometers to the dissipation scales. Transport by ocean currents plays an important role in many practical applications ranging from climatic problems to coastal management and accident mitigation at sea. Understanding transport is challenging because of the chaotic nature of particle motion. In the last decade, new methods have been put forth to improve our understanding of transport. Powerful tools are provided by dynamical system theory, that allow the identification of the barriers to transport and their time variability for a given flow. A shortcoming of this approach, though, is that it is based on the assumption that the velocity field is known with good accuracy, which is not always the case in practical applications. Improving model performance in terms of transport can be addressed using another important methodology that has been recently developed, namely the assimilation of Lagrangian data provided by floating buoys. The two methodologies are technically different but in many ways complementary. In this paper, we review examples of applications of both methodologies performed by the authors in the last few years, considering flows at different scales and in various ocean basins. The results are among the very first examples of applications of the methodologies to the real ocean including testing with Lagrangian in-situ data.

https://openalex.org/W2175727715,"A Practical, Hybrid Model for Predicting the Trajectories of Near-Surface Ocean Drifters",,"A hybrid Lagrangian‐Eulerian model for calculating the trajectories of near-surface drifters in the ocean is developed in this study. The model employs climatological, near-surface currents computed from a spline fit of all available drifter velocities observed in the Pacific Ocean between 1988 and 1996. It also incorporates contemporaneous wind fields calculated by either the U.S. Navy [the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS)] or the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The model was applied to 30 drifters launched in the tropical Pacific Ocean in three clusters during 1990, 1993, and 1994. For 10-day-long trajectories the forecasts computed by the hybrid model are up to 164% closer to the observed trajectories compared to the trajectories obtained by advecting the drifters with the climatological currents only. The best-fitting trajectories are computed with ECMWF fields that have a temporal resolution of 6 h. The average improvement over all 30 drifters of the hybrid model trajectories relative to advection by the climatological currents is 21%, but in the open-ocean clusters (1990 and 1993) the improvement is 42% with ECMWF winds (34% with NOGAPS winds). This difference between the open-ocean and coastal clusters is due to the fact that the model does not presently include the effect of horizontal boundaries (coastlines). For zero initial velocities the trajectories generated by the hybrid model are significantly more accurate than advection by the mean currents on time scales of 5‐15 days. For 3-day-long trajectories significant improvement is achieved if the drifter’s initial velocity is known, in which case the model-generated trajectories are about 2 times closer to observations than persistence. The model’s success in providing more accurate trajectories indicates that drifters’ motion can deviate significantly from the climatological current and that the instantaneous winds are more relevant to their trajectories than the mean surface currents. It also demonstrates the importance of an accurate initial velocity, especially for short trajectories on the order of 1‐3 days. A possible interpretation of these results is that winds affect drifter motion more than the water velocity since drifters do not obey continuity.",2004-08-01,NA,Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology,https://openalex.org/V135937692,American Meteorological Society,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,10,,2004,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2175727715,,https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0426(2004)021<1246:aphmfp>2.0.co;2,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W3037416750,Hydrodynamics and dilution of an oil jet in crossflow: The role of small-scale motions from laboratory experiment and large eddy simulations,,"Abstract Experimental results were presented for the release of diesel oil from a one-inch (2.5 cm) vertical pipe in a crossflow at 0.27 m/s. The ratio of jet velocity to crossflow speed was 5.0 and the Reynolds number based on jet velocity and pipe diameter was 7.1 × 10 3 . In the experiments, the plume shape was photographed, and the oil droplets were measured at two vertical locations on the center axis of the plume. Acoustic Doppler velocimetry (ADV) data was also obtained and compared to numerical predictions. The plume was simulated using large eddy simulation (LES), and the mixture multiphase model. The impact of the oil buoyancy was captured by adding a transport term to the volume fraction equation. Using the rise velocity based on d50 (volume-median) droplet size in the lower part of the plume allowed us to capture the lower boundary of the plume, but the estimated upper boundary of the plume penetrated less into the crossflow as compared to the experimental findings. However, using the rise velocity of the d50 at the upper part of the plume allowed one to estimate the upper boundary of the plume. As the droplets are too small to be resolved by the LES, we could not use a systematic approach to allow the multiphase plume to spread to mimic the observations. Based on the simulation results, the interaction between the jet and crossflow yielded small-sized flow structures near the upper boundary of the plume. The wake vortices initiated from the leeward side of the plume showed an alternating vorticity pattern in the wake. The shear layer vortices were induced by Kevin-Helmholtz instabilities mostly on the windward side of the plume. The formation of counter rotating vortex pair (CVP) altered greatly the hydrodynamics of the jet from that of a vertical jet to manifest flow reversals in all directions. The formation of CVP is likely to enhance the mixing of chemicals and droplets within the plume.",2020-10-01,NA,International Journal of Heat and Fluid Flow,https://openalex.org/V40322869,Elsevier,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/am/pii/S0142727X1931255X,108634,108634,85,NA,TRUE,10,,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3037416750,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheatfluidflow.2020.108634,journal-article,,,

Vertical velocities are challenging not only to model accurately, but also to measure because of how difficult they are to locate in the surface waters of the ocean. Using unique massive drifter releases during the Lagrangian Submesoscale Experiment (LASER) campaign in the Gulf of Mexico and the Coherent Lagrangian Pathways from the Surface Ocean to the Interior (CALYPSO) experiment in the Mediterranean Sea, we investigate the generation of submesoscale structures along two different mesoscale fronts. We use a novel method to project Lagrangian trajectories to Eulerian velocity fields, in order to calculate horizontal velocity gradients at the surface, which are used as a proxy for vertical transport. The velocity reconstruction uses a squared-exponential covariance function, which characterizes velocity correlations in horizontal space and time, and determines the scales of variation using the data itself. SST and towed CTD measurements support the findings revealed by the drifter data.

The Ship-Tethered Aerostat Remote Sensing System (STARSS) was developed to measure Lagrangian velocities at the air-sea interface by tracking the transport and dispersion of hundreds of drift cards in the field of view of a high-resolution aerial imaging system. The camera had a field of view of approximately 300 m X 200 m and images were obtained every 15 seconds over periods of up to 3 hours during a series of experiments in the northern Gulf of Mexico in January-February 2016. STARSS was equipped with a GPS and inertial navigation system (INS) that was used to directly georectify the aerial images. A relative rectification technique was developed that translates and rotates the drift cards to minimize the total movement of all drift cards from one frame to the next. Rectified drift card positions were used to quantify scale-dependent dispersion by computing relative dispersion, relative diffusivity, and velocity structure functions. STARSS was part of a nested observational framework, which included deployments of large numbers of GPS-tracked surface drifters from two ships, in situ ocean measurements, and X-band radar observations of surface currents. STARSS operations were supported by weather forecasts from a high-resolution coupled atmosphere-wave-ocean model. Here we describe the STARSS system and image analysis techniques, and present results from an experiment that was conducted on a density front.

In particular, we model a gravity current evolving under an assumed shear-flow. The transport equation is deterministic, with a noise term at the inlet boundary . This was motivated by observed seasonal fluctuations in some known sources of salty, dense water in the oceans, like the Red Sea overflow, as well as observed thermal and saline anomalies in the thermohaline circulation. The noises used were: Wiener white, Wiener colored, Levy white, and Levy colored noise. Levy processes form a more general class of processes which are generally non-Gaussian in distribution, and may have infinitely many jumps in finite time. They have been used to model pollutant point-sources, the flight time of particles in vortices, and linear and nonlinear anomalous diffusion. The major finding was that white noises (Wiener and Levy ) and colored Wiener noise all have the effect of impeding the diffusion process, by as much as 33%. However, colored Levy noise (non-Gaussian, time-correlated) does not have this effect on diffusion. This would suggest that time-correlation is more important in distinguishing noises than the distribution of the process that produced the noise. This also explains why Levy colored noise showed great sensitivity to the stability parameter α , while Levy white noise is unaffected by its stability parameter.",2008-10-01,NA,Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation,https://openalex.org/V39612629,Elsevier,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,8,,2008,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2089594046,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2006.09.019,journal-article,,,

https://openalex.org/W2739804347,Numerical simulations of rotating bubble plumes in stratified environments,,"The effects of system rotation on the turbulent dynamics of bubble plumes evolving in stratified environments are numerically investigated by considering variations in both the system rotation rate and the gas-phase slip velocity. The turbulent dispersion of a passive scalar injected at the source of a buoyant plume is strongly altered by the rotation of the system and the nature of the buoyancy at the source. When the plume is driven by the density defect associated with the presence of slipping gas bubbles, the location of the main lateral intrusion decreases with respect to the single-phase case with identical inlet volume, momentum, and buoyancy fluxes. Enhanced downdrafts of carrier phase fluid result in increased turbulent mixing and short-circuiting of detraining plume water that elevate near-field effluent concentrations. Similarly, rotation fundamentally alters dynamic balances within the plume leading to the encroachment of the trapping height on the source and an increase in turbulent dispersion in the near field. System rotation, even at modest Rossby numbers, produces a sustained, robust, anticyclonic precession of the plume core. The effects of rotation and the presence of bubbles are cumulative. The vertical encroachment of the primary intrusion and the overall dispersion of effluent are greatest at smallest Rossby numbers and largest slip velocities. The main characteristic feature in rotating single-phase plumes, namely the robust anticyclonic precession, persists in bubble plumes. Analysis of the momentum budgets reveal that the mechanism responsible for the organized precession, i.e., the establishment of an unstable vertical hydrostatic equilibrium related to radial cyclostrophic balance, does not differ from the single-phase case.",2017-08-01,NA,Journal Of Geophysical Research: Oceans,https://openalex.org/V4210200322,Wiley,,https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/am-pdf/10.1002/2017jc013110,6795,6813,122,8,TRUE,8,,2017,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2739804347,,https://doi.org/10.1002/2017jc013110,journal-article,,,

As GOMRI sunsets in its tenth year after the DWH oil spill, synthesis efforts recently took place to assess the accomplishments of the program. In this paper, we report on DWH modeling as part of GOMRI's Synthesis and Legacy effort. We compile a list of 330 published applications by GOMRI, the Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA), and others studying the DWH oil spill and look at a wide range of subjects, tools, achievements, and integration with field research. We offer highlights and synthesis based on discussions and public webinars held in 2019 and 2020. We synthesize the significant achievements and advancements that have been made in integrating the various disciplines and domains from a modeling perspective. There was a large diversity of tools used, including at least 74 unique modeling systems. Most studies employed circulation models. These hydrodynamic models were often coupled to wave, river, and atmosphere models, as well as representations of high pressure physics and oil chemistry. Several research groups used Lagrangian transport models and statistical inference to track subsurface oil. Some coupled biophysical models were also employed to study oil fate and weathering, larval transport, biological effects, and population dynamics. In a few cases, such biophysical models were linked to marine populations and to humans through socioeconomics effects and ecosystem services. We consider models made for response planning and remediation, damage assessment, and restoration planning. There are relatively few socioeconomic or human health models, although those few examples make good use of biophysical modeling products.

By scaling the ratio of the strength of the recirculation to that of the sink by that from the inviscid solution, the regimes are identified in which friction becomes a dominant factor. The primary new finding of this study is that the recirculating flow component disappears due to frictional effects when the meridional extent of the sink becomes small. Unlike for the zonal extent of the sink, which affects the recirculating component only if it is on the order of the frictional boundary layer scale, the deviation of the recirculating flow strength from that given by the inviscid solution is apparent for meridional sink scales, which are much larger than the frictional boundary layer scale.

The question of appropriate boundary conditions is still challenging for most complex flows. Gravity currents make no exception—appropriate, physically and mathematically sound boundary conditions are yet to be found. This task is further complicated by the technical limitations imposed by the current oceanographic techniques. In this paper, we make a first step toward a better understanding of the impact of boundary conditions on gravity currents. Specifically, we use direct numerical simulations to investigate the effect that the popular Neumann, and less popular Dirichlet boundary conditions on the bottom continental shelf have on the entrainment and transport of gravity currents. The finding is that gravity currents under these two different boundary conditions differ most in the way they transport heat from the top towards the bottom. This major difference occurs at medium temperature ranges. Entrainment and transport at high temperatures also show significant differences.",2007-07-01,NA,Applied Mathematical Modelling,https://openalex.org/V153281200,Elsevier,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2006.03.033,1338,1350,31,7,TRUE,7,,2007,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2164379783,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2006.03.033,journal-article,,,

Surface drifters sampling the first meter of water (CARTHE and CODE) and 15 m drifters (SVP) are considered. The area of interest is dominated by processes of strong frontogenesis and eddy formation as well as mixing, related to the high lateral gradients between Mediterranean and Atlantic waters. Drifter coverage and distribution allow to investigate the dependence of KPs on horizontal scales in a range between 1 and 16 km, that effectively bridges submesoscale and mesoscale processes, and at two depths, of 1 and 15 m. For both experiments, the surface flow is highly ageostrophic at 1 km scale, with positive vorticity skewness indicating the presence of submesoscale features. Surface divergence quickly decreases at increasing scales with a slope compatible with a turbulent process with broadband wavenumber spectrum, suggesting the influence of surface boundary layer processes such as wind effects, waves and Langmuir cells at the smaller scales. Vorticity, on the other hand, has a significantly slower decay, suggesting interaction between submesoscale and mesoscale dynamics. Results at 15 m are characterized by reduced ageostrophic dynamics with respect to the surface, especially for divergence. Submesoscale processes are present but appear attenuated in terms of KP magnitude and skewness. The results are generally consistent for the two experiments, despite the observed differences in the mixed layer stratification, suggesting that submesoscale instabilities occur mostly at surface fronts associated with filaments of Atlantic and Mediterranean waters that are present in both cases. The results are compared with previous literature results in other parts of the world ocean and a synthesis is provided. Good agreement with previous surface results is found, suggesting some general properties for divergence and vorticity scale dependence.

SIWs appear at small Rossby numbers (0.01 ≤ Ro ≤ 1) according to our parameter sweep experiments; the amplitude, wavelength and frequency of SIWs are sensitive to Rossby numbers. We extend the Lighthill–Ford radiation into inertial waves, and propose an indicator for the emission of inertial waves; this indicator may be adopted into general circulation models to parameterize inertial waves. Additionally, in our tracer releasing experiments, SIWs organize tracers into spirals, and modify the tracer’s local rate of change by advecting tracers vertically. Further, the spirals of SIWs resembles some spiral features observed in the ocean and atmosphere, such as spiral ocean eddies and spiral hurricane rainbands; thus, SIWs may offer another mechanism to form spiral eddies and rainbands. Since no density anomaly is required to generate the spirals of SIWs, we infer that the density anomaly, hence the baroclinic or frontal instability, is unlikely to be the key factor in the formation of these spiral features.",2016-03-01,NA,Ocean Modelling,https://openalex.org/V33756829,Elsevier,,http://manuscript.elsevier.com/S1463500316000020/pdf/S1463500316000020.pdf,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,6,,2016,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2237661021,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2016.01.001,journal-article,,,

The present paper applies modern numerical techniques to study this problem, focussing specifically on the DwH event. The gas/oil/seawater nature of the problem requires a ‘multiphase’ approach, which is relatively unfamiliar in physical oceanography, although applications are becoming more common. The model is cast in an Eulerian framework and includes feedbacks between the convection and the environment, unlike past oil/gas plume simulations that adopt a semi-passive, Lagrangian approach. Fully three dimensional (3d) simulations are too computationally demanding for practical multi-day use, so a two-dimensional (2d) radially symmetric model is developed from the equations and calibrated to the 3d results. Both the 2d and 3d solutions show the somewhat unexpected result that oil/bubble plumes modelled after the DwH event are strongly affected by rotation and exert a considerable dynamic feedback on the ambient. These effects are not typically included in classical oil/gas plume models.",2017-11-01,NA,Ocean Modelling,https://openalex.org/V33756829,Elsevier,,NA,118,135,119,NA,FALSE,6,,2017,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2767076776,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2017.10.005,journal-article,,,

The objective of this research was to identify more accurate oil exposure dates based on oil spill chemical concentrations changes (CCC) within sediments in coastal zones after oil spills. The results could be used to help improve oil transport models and to improve estimates of oil landings within the nearshore. The CCC method was based on separating the target coastal zone into segments and then documenting the timing of large increases in concentration for specific oil spill chemicals (OSCs) within each segment. The dataset from the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill was used to illustrate the application of the method. Some differences in exposure dates were observed between the CCC method and between oil spill trajectories. Differences may have been caused by mixing at the freshwater and sea water interface, nearshore circulation features, and the possible influence of submerged oil that is unaccounted for by oil spill trajectories.

We report experimental results of an oil jet with release velocity around 1.5 m/s in a crossflow of 0.3 m/s. The hydrodynamics of the jet obtained with the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) were used to predict the migration of the oil droplets. Two Lagrangian techniques were explored, one with the inertia of the droplet is considered and the other that treats the droplets as massless particles with rising velocities corresponding to their size. We did not note a large difference between the two approaches. The droplets showed stronger segregation in the vertical direction, which renders the usage of a Gaussian distribution approximation in the vertical inapplicable. The dispersion coefficient at each direction was computed for different-sized droplets. The eddy diffusivity computed based on Boussinesq gradient approximation using the LES data was compared with the dispersion coefficients obtained based on Lagrangian tracking. We also found that droplets 500 μ m and larger escape the vortex while smaller ones get trapped within the vortex. A similar outcome was observed using a vortex trapping function based on inward–outward force balancing at the elevation of the vortex core. The counter-rotating vortex pair (CVP) altered the distribution of droplets of 1 mm and smaller significantly, and bimodal concentration distributions with peaks near the CVP vortex cores and minimum concentration near the center plane were obtained in the lateral–horizontal​ direction. Therefore, measurements of the oil droplet size distribution (DSD) in the center plane of crossflow jets could underestimate the number of small droplets in the whole plume. • Oil droplet transport with Lagrangian techniques using the hydrodynamics obtained through large eddy simulation. • Larger droplets were observed near the top boundary of the plume in our experiments. • Eddy diffusivity based on Boussinesq approximation using LES and the dispersion coefficients based on Lagrangian tracking. • Trapping of 400 μ m and smaller droplets in the counter rotating vortex pair. • Droplet size distribution in the center plane of crossflow jets could underestimate the number of small droplets in the whole plume.",2021-02-01,NA,Ocean Modelling,https://openalex.org/V33756829,Elsevier,,NA,101736,101736,158,NA,FALSE,6,,2021,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3113155721,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2020.101736,journal-article,,,

Focusing on barotropic, inertial and 3D instabilities, we investigate the joint impacts of instabilities on 3D transport by using analytical methods and direct numerical simulations. We discover for the first time that material can be exchanged through 3D pathways which link a family of vortices generated by the instabilities in a single, initially unstable vortex. We also show that instabilities can increase the magnitude of vertical velocity, mixing rate and vertical material exchange.

https://openalex.org/W2601980624,Flow splitting in numerical simulations of oceanic dense-water outflows,,"Abstract Flow splitting occurs when part of a gravity current becomes neutrally buoyant and separates from the bottom-trapped plume as an interflow. This phenomenon has been previously observed in laboratory experiments, small-scale water bodies (e.g., lakes) and numerical studies of small-scale systems. Here, the potential for flow splitting in oceanic gravity currents is investigated using high-resolution (Δx = Δz = 5  m) two-dimensional numerical simulations of gravity flows into linearly stratified environments. The model is configured to solve the non-hydrostatic Boussinesq equations without rotation. A set of experiments is conducted by varying the initial buoyancy number B 0 = Q 0 N 3 / g ′ 2 (where Q0 is the volume flux of the dense water flow per unit width, N is the ambient stratification and g′ is the reduced gravity), the bottom slope (α) and the turbulent Prandtl number (Pr). Regardless of α or Pr, when B0 ≤ 0.002 the outflow always reaches the deep ocean forming an underflow. Similarly, when B0 ≥ 0.13 the outflow always equilibrates at intermediate depths, forming an interflow. However, when B0 ∼ 0.016, flow splitting always occurs when Pr ≥ 10, while interflows always occur for Pr = 1. An important characteristic of simulations that result in flow splitting is the development of Holmboe-like interfacial instabilities and flow transition from a supercritical condition, where the Froude number (Fr) is greater than one, to a slower and more uniform subcritical condition (Fr",2017-05-01,NA,Ocean Modelling,https://openalex.org/V33756829,Elsevier,,http://manuscript.elsevier.com/S1463500317300422/pdf/S1463500317300422.pdf,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,5,,2017,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2601980624,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2017.03.011,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W2920044067,Vertical structure of ocean surface currents under high winds from massive arrays of drifters,,"Abstract. Very-near-surface ocean currents are dominated by wind and wave forcing and have large impacts on the transport of buoyant materials in the ocean. Surface currents, however, are under-resolved in most operational ocean models due to the difficultly of measuring ocean currents close to, or directly at, the air–sea interface with many modern instrumentations. Here, observations of ocean currents at two depths within the first meter of the surface are made utilizing trajectory data from both drogued and undrogued Consortium for Advanced Research on Transport of Hydrocarbon in the Environment (CARTHE) drifters, which have draft depths of 60 and 5 cm, respectively. Trajectory data of dense, colocated drogued and undrogued drifters were collected during the Lagrangian Submesoscale Experiment (LASER) that took place from January to March of 2016 in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Examination of the drifter data reveals that the drifter velocities become strongly wind- and wave-driven during periods of high wind, with the pre-existing regional circulation having a smaller, but non-negligible, influence on the total drifter velocities. During these high wind events, we deconstruct the total drifter velocities of each drifter type into their wind- and wave-driven components after subtracting an estimate for the regional circulation, which pre-exists each wind event. In order to capture the regional circulation in the absence of strong wind and wave forcing, a Lagrangian variational method is used to create hourly velocity field estimates for both drifter types separately, during the hours preceding each high wind event. Synoptic wind and wave output data from the Unified Wave INterface-Coupled Model (UWIN-CM), a fully coupled atmosphere, wave and ocean circulation model, are used for analysis. The wind-driven component of the drifter velocities exhibits a rotation to the right with depth between the velocities measured by undrogued and drogued drifters. We find that the average wind-driven velocity of undrogued drifters (drogued drifters) is ∼3.4 %–6.0 % (∼2.3 %–4.1 %) of the wind speed and is deflected ∼5–55∘ (∼30–85∘) to the right of the wind, reaching higher deflection angles at higher wind speeds.

https://openalex.org/W3092702234,Predicting particle trajectories in oceanic flows using artificial neural networks,,"Predicting ocean transport has many practical applications ranging from search and rescue operations to predicting the spread of oil, debris, and biogeochemical tracers, yet trajectory prediction remains a challenge for existing ocean modeling techniques. General circulation models require high resolution observational data in order to be properly initialized, but these data do not exist for the ocean. Statistical models are difficult to tune with existing data and are often too simple to accurately encapsulate turbulent flows. Here we investigate a data-driven approach to ocean transport prediction wherein the goal is to first learn from available data instead of prescribed laws of physics and then apply this information to new data. More specifically, we explore whether simple artificial neural networks (ANNs) are capable of learning to predict 2D particle trajectories using only previous velocity observations. ANNs are trained in two ways: first, a so-called “one-to-one ANN” uses a particle’s most recently observed velocity to predict its velocity six hours later, and second, a “time series ANN” uses the past 24 hours’ worth of velocity observations to predict the next 24 h. We present a proof-of-concept considering particles in a hierarchy of simulated flow regimes ranging from uniform, steady flow to more complex scenarios with interacting scales of motion and then substantiate our approach on trajectories in modeled flows generated by a high-resolution Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model for a mesoscale eddy in the northern Gulf of Mexico. We also assess ANN sensitivity to the prediction window over which forecasts are made, the number of training particles used, and the size of the network. ANNs successfully predict 24 h trajectories within the temporal bounds of the training data with forecast errors around half those of both rudimentary persistence and classical ARIMA models. Predicting beyond the domain of the training data leads to forecast errors comparable to ARIMA models. Our results suggest that ANNs offer promising potential as a data-driven approach to forecasting material transport in the ocean. • Neural networks (NN) are helpful in learning particle trajectories in oceanic flows. • Forecasting capability based on observational data alone. • Simple network topologies predict new trajectories from training trajectories. • Trained NN forecasts outperform persistence and autoregressive models.",2020-12-01,NA,Ocean Modelling,https://openalex.org/V33756829,Elsevier,,NA,101707,101707,156,NA,FALSE,5,,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3092702234,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2020.101707,journal-article,,,

In many cases the assessment of errors is limited by the observational data set, therefore, large eddy simulations from a spectral element Boussinesq solver are taken as ground truth. First, the lock-exchange problem is used to quantify the temporal evolution of mixing from shear-driven stratified overturns. It is found that mixing in an OGCM is more sensitive to the choice of grid resolution than any other parameters tested here. The results do not monotonically converge towards the ground truth as the resolution is refined.

We find that χ remains constant over 1.5 times the significant wave height, while over a layer below, χ decays based on the local surface forcing. When the heat flux is dominant, traditional scaling based on the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory remains valid; χ ∝ z−1. When the wind stress dominates, we observe the emergence of a new scaling, χ ∝ z−1/2, which is explained by invoking the effect of small-scale coherent structures on vertical heat transport.

Initially, drifters designed for oil spill response were intended to remotely track trajectories of accidental spills and help guide responders. Most recently, inexpensive biodegradable drifters were developed for massive deployments, making it possible to significantly improve numerical transport models and to investigate, via observations, the processes leading to dispersion and accumulation of surface pollutants across multiple scales. Over the past 50 years, drifters have benefited from constant improvements in electronics for accurate and frequent location and data transmission, as well as progress in material sciences to reduce fabrication costs and minimize the environmental impact of sacrificial instruments. The large amount of in-situ data provided by drifters, covering a broad area, is crucial to validate the numerical models and remote sensing products that are becoming more important in guiding response and policy decisions.",2018-11-01,NA,Marine Technology Society Journal,https://openalex.org/V42930874,Marine Technology Society,,https://doi.org/10.4031/mtsj.52.6.9,53,61,52,6,TRUE,4,,2018,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2907900525,,https://doi.org/10.4031/mtsj.52.6.9,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W2956724780,Wind‐Based Estimations of Ocean Surface Currents From Massive Clusters of Drifters in the Gulf of Mexico,,"During the Lagrangian submesoscale experiment (LASER), 1,000 drifters were launched to sample the surface ocean flow in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Due to half a dozen strong winter storms, about 40% of the drifters lost their drogue. This unintended situation facilitated documentation of both near-surface (5 cm) and deeper (60 cm) flows. These depths are relevant to transport of oil spills, as well as marine debris, such as microplastics, a rapidly growing environmental problem. Here, we improve the surface Lagrangian current prediction by combining a state-of-the-art ocean forecast model with wind and wave data. The ocean surface velocities are obtained from the Navy Coordinate Ocean Model at 1-km horizontal resolution, while the wind and wave fields are from the Unified Wave INterface Coupled Model coupled atmosphere-wave-ocean model. Two Lagrangian parameterizations are tested: one is based on Ekman dynamics, and the other directly on the surface winds. LASER data set is then used to assess the performance of these formulations, as a function of wind/wave conditions, as well as geographic region. It is found that incorporation of wind and wave data into the ocean circulation model can lead to major prediction improvement, by reducing the average 2-day separation from the modeled and real LASER trajectories by a factor ranging from 1.4 to 4.9. This is a significant improvement for applications, where a rapid deployment of assets is needed, such as oil spill response, or other tracking problems.",2019-08-01,NA,Journal Of Geophysical Research: Oceans,https://openalex.org/V4210200322,Wiley,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2018JC014813,5844,5869,124,8,TRUE,4,,2019,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2956724780,,https://doi.org/10.1029/2018jc014813,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W3166109132,Physical Transport Processes that Affect the Distribution of Oil in the Gulf of Mexico: Observations and Modeling,,"Physical transport processes such as the circulation and mixing of waters largely determine the spatial distribution of materials in the ocean. They also establish the physical environment within which biogeochemical and other processes transform materials, including naturally occurring nutrients and human-made contaminants that may sustain or harm the region’s living resources. Thus, understanding and modeling the transport and distribution of materials provides a crucial substrate for determining the effects of biological, geological, and chemical processes. The wide range of scales in which these physical processes operate includes microscale droplets and bubbles; small-scale turbulence in buoyant plumes and the near-surface “mixed” layer; submesoscale fronts, convergent and divergent flows, and small eddies; larger mesoscale quasi-geostrophic eddies; and the overall large-scale circulation of the Gulf of Mexico and its interaction with the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea; along with air-sea interaction on longer timescales. The circulation and mixing processes that operate near the Gulf of Mexico coasts, where most human activities occur, are strongly affected by wind- and river-induced currents and are further modified by the area’s complex topography. Gulf of Mexico physical processes are also characterized by strong linkages between coastal/shelf and deeper offshore waters that determine connectivity to the basin’s interior. This physical connectivity influences the transport of materials among different coastal areas within the Gulf of Mexico and can extend to adjacent basins. Major advances enabled by the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative in the observation, understanding, and modeling of all of these aspects of the Gulf’s physical environment are summarized in this article, and key priorities for future work are also identified.",2021-03-01,NA,Oceanography,https://openalex.org/V92941125,The Oceanography Society,,https://tos.org/oceanography/assets/docs/34-1_boufadel.pdf,58,75,34,1,TRUE,4,,2021,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3166109132,,https://doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2021.117,journal-article,,,
https://openalex.org/W3189476592,On the Structure and Kinematics of an Algerian Eddy in the Southwestern Mediterranean Sea,,"An Algerian Eddy, anticyclonic vortex generated by the instability of the Algerian Current in the southwestern Mediterranean Sea, is studied using data provided by drifters (surface currents), Argo floats (temperature and salinity profiles), environmental satellites (absolute dynamic topography maps and ocean color images) and operational oceanography products. The eddy was generated in May 2018 and lasted as an isolated vortex until November 2018. Its morphology and kinematics are described in June–July 2018 when drifters were trapped in its core. During that period, the eddy was slowly moving to the NE (~2 km/day), with an overall diameter of about 200 km (slowly growing with time) and maximal surface swirl velocity of ~50 cm/s at a radius of ~50 km. Geostrophic currents derived from satellite altimetry data compare well with low-pass filtered drifter velocities, with only a slight overestimation, which is expected as its maximum vorticity corresponds to a small Rossby number of ~0.6. Satellite ocean color images and some drifters show that the eddy has an elliptical spiral structure. The looping tracks of the drifters trapped in the eddy were analyzed using two statistical methods: least-squares ellipse fitting and wavelet ridge analysis, revealing a typical eccentricity of about 0.5, a wide range of inclination and a rotation period between 3 and 10 days. Clusters of drifters on the northeastern limb of the eddy were also considered to estimate divergence and vorticity. The results indicate convergence (divergence) and downwelling (upwelling) at scales of 20–50 km near the northeastern (northwestern) edge of the eddy, in agreement with the quasi-geostrophic theory. Vertically, the eddy extends mostly down to 250 m depth, with a warm, low-salinity and low-density signature and with geostrophic currents near 50 cm/s in the top layer (down to ~80 m) reducing to less than 10 cm/s near 250 m.

It fuses into one group investigators with unique scientific and technical knowledge and extensive publications related to oil fate/transport processes, oceanic and atmospheric turbulence, air-sea interactions, tropical cyclones and winter storms, and coastal and nearshore modeling and observations. Our primary goal is to accurately predict the fate of hydrocarbons released into the environment. Achieving this goal is particularly challenging since petroleum releases into the environment interact with natural processes across six orders of magnitude of time and space scales. We are developing a multi-scale modeling tool by incorporating state-of-the-art hydrophysical models, each applicable for a restricted range of scales, into a single, interconnected modeling system to predict the physical dispersal of hydrocarbons across scales ranging from the microscale at the wellhead to oceanic and atmospheric mesoscales.

https://openalex.org/W3100134600,A novel method to evaluate chemical concentrations in muddy and sandy coastal regions before and after oil exposures,,"Oil spills can result in changes in chemical concentrations along coastlines. In prior work, these concentration changes were used to evaluate the date sediment was impacted by oil (i.e., oil exposure date). The objective of the current study was to build upon prior work by using the oil exposure date to compute oil spill chemical (OSC) concentrations in shoreline sediments before and after exposure. The new method was applied to OSC concentration measures collected during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill with an emphasis on evaluating before and after concentrations in muddy versus sandy regions. The procedure defined a grid that overlaid coastal areas with chemical concentration measurement locations. These grids were then aggregated into clusters to allow the assignment of chemical concentration measurements to a uniform coastal type. Performance of the method was illustrated for ten chemicals individually by cluster, and collectively for all chemicals and all clusters. Results show statistically significant differences between chemical concentrations before and after the calculated oil exposure dates (p < 0.04 for each of the 10 chemicals within the identified clusters). When aggregating all chemical measures collectively across all clusters, chemical concentrations were lower before oil exposure in comparison to after (p < 0.0001). Sandy coastlines exhibited lower chemical concentrations relative to muddy coastlines (p < 0.0001). Overall, the method developed is a useful first step for establishing baseline chemical concentrations and for assessing the impacts of disasters on sediment quality within different coastline types.

We present experimental results of an oil jet with a jet-to-crossflow velocity ratio of 9.3. The oil was released from a vertical pipe 25 mm in diameter with a Reynolds number of 25 000. We measured the size of oil droplets near the top and bottom boundaries of the plume using shadowgraph cameras and we also filmed the whole plume. In parallel, we developed a multifluid large eddy simulation model to simulate the plume and coupled it with our VDROP population balance model to compute the local droplet size. We accounted for the slip velocity of oil droplets in the momentum equation and in the volume fraction equation of oil through the local, mass-weighted average droplet rise velocity. The top and bottom boundaries of the plume were captured well in the simulation. Larger droplets shaped the upper boundary of the plume, and the mean droplet size increased with elevation across the plume, most likely due to the individual rise velocity of droplets. At the same elevation across the plume, the droplet size was smaller at the centre axis as compared with the side boundaries of the plume due to the formation of the counter-rotating vortex pair, which induced upward velocity at the centre axis and downward velocity near the sides of the plume.",2021-12-02,NA,Journal of Fluid Mechanics,https://openalex.org/V152000018,Cambridge University Press,,NA,NA,NA,932,NA,FALSE,3,,2021,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3216329159,,https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2021.1002,journal-article,,,

Using the empirical data, several formulations of the stochastic boundary condition (SBC) are then developed and evaluated for the parameterization of sub-grid scale variability along the western boundaries of an ocean general circulation model (OGCM). These SBCs are compared to both no-slip and free-slip boundary conditions along the western boundary of a channel model simulating separation of the boundary current at a cape, as well as simulations of the classic, wind-forced double-gyre circulation. Our studies indicate that simulated circulation patterns are sensitive to both the functional form of the SBC and the parameters used in a given formulation. In particular, a relatively simple, auto-regressive formulation of SBC can be applied to a coarse-resolution, eddy-permitting OGCM to increase flow turbulence and to affect the flow patterns in ways distinct from the standard, deterministic no-slip and free-slip boundary conditions. Correlation time scales of a few days to weeks, orders of magnitude larger than a typical time step of OGCM, are needed in the regression model for SBC.

The two applications are characterized by different dynamics, and the estimates of kinematic properties are derived from distinctly different observational approaches: in situ GPS drifters observations and remote HF radar data.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Ligurian Sea application is based on HF radar measurements obtained for the JERICO-NEXT (Joint European Research Infrastructure network for Coastal Observatory &amp;amp;#8211; Novel European eXpertise for coastal observaTories) and IMPACT (Port Impact on Protected Marine Areas: Cooperative Cross-Border Actions) projects. Surface current measurements span 40 km off the coast with 1.5 km resolution, available every hour. The velocity fields are used to estimate the kinematic properties with an Eulerian approach, which allows the identification of structures such as eddies and jets of the order of a few km. We focus in particular on the response of the submesoscales to an extreme wind event that was captured by the observations.

Nearly collocated and simultaneous drifter measurements in the southwestern Mediterranean reveal that the CARTHE and CODE drifters measure the currents in the first meter below the surface in approximately the same way. When compared to SVP drogued at 15 m nominal depth, the CODE and CARTHE currents are essentially downwind (and down-wave), with a typical speed of 0.5-1% of the wind speed. However, there is a large scatter in velocity differences between CODE/CARTHE and SVP for all wind and sea state conditions encountered, principally due to vertical and horizontal shears not related to the wind.

https://openalex.org/W2182216980,NOTES AND CORRESPONDENCE On the Dynamics of b Plumes,,"The dynamics of zonal recirculating flows ( b plumes) driven by a source of potential vorticity, or a sink of mass, located at the eastern boundary of an ocean basin are investigated using analytical solutions of the barotropic, linear, steady quasigeostrophic equation with bottom and lateral friction. By scaling the ratio of the strength of the recirculation to that of the sink by that from the inviscid solution, the regimes are identified in which friction becomes a dominant factor. The primary new finding of this study is that the recirculating flow component disappears due to frictional effects when the meridional extent of the sink becomes small. Unlike for the zonal extent of the sink, which affects the recirculating component only if it is on the order of the frictional boundary layer scale, the deviation of the recirculating flow strength from that given by the inviscid solution is apparent for meridional sink scales, which are much larger than the frictional boundary layer scale. Also, location of the maximum recirculation and westward penetration distance of the plumes are quantified. Finally, a stability analysis is conducted to determine the parameter regime in which the b plumes are candidates for instability.",2001-01-01,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,0,,2001,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2182216980,,NA,NA,,,

https://openalex.org/W2962990652,Impact of Boundary Conditions on Entrainment and Transport in Gravity Currents,,"Gravity currents have been studied numerically and experimentally both in the laboratory and in the ocean. The question of appropriate boundary conditions is still challenging for most complex flows. Gravity currents make no exception - appropriate, physically and mathematically sound boundary conditions are yet to be found. This task is further complicated by the technical limitations imposed by the current oceanographic techniques. 
In this paper, we make a first step toward a better understanding of the impact of boundary conditions on gravity currents. Specifically, we use direct numerical simulations to investigate the effect that the popular Neumann, and less popular Dirichlet boundary conditions on the bottom continental shelf have on the entrainment and transport of gravity currents. 
The finding is that gravity currents under these two different boundary conditions differ most in the way they transport heat from the top towards the bottom. This major difference occurs at medium temperature ranges. Entrainment and transport at high temperatures also show significant differences.",2006-05-22,NA,arXiv e-prints,https://openalex.org/V4306503228,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,0,,2006,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2962990652,,NA,posted-content,,,

Focusing on barotropic, inertial and 3D instabilities, we investigate the joint impacts of instabilities on 3D transport by using analytical methods and direct numerical simulations. We discover for the first time that material can be exchanged through 3D pathways which link a family of vortices generated by the instabilities in a single, initially unstable vortex. We also show that instabilities can increase the magnitude of vertical velocity, mixing rate and vertical material exchange. Besides, we find that instabilities can cause the kinetic energy wavenumber spectrum to have a power-law regime different than the classic regimes of k - 5 / 3 and k - 3 , and propose a new energy spectrum to interpret the non-classic regime.",2014-12-01,NA,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,https://openalex.org/V4306501062,NA,,NA,NA,NA,2014,NA,FALSE,0,,2014,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2995655918,,NA,NA,,,

The near-surface layer (0–9 m) averaged TD did not vary significantly across the front. The deep layer frontal asymmetry coincided with depths where the Thorpe scale was large.

https://openalex.org/W3166867678,Spiral inertial waves emitted from geophysical vortices,,"Abstract By numerically simulating an initially unstable geophysical vortex, we discover for the first time a special kind of inertial waves, which are emitted in a spiral manner from the vortices; we refer to these waves as spiral inertial waves (SIWs). SIWs appear at small Rossby numbers (0.01 ≤ Ro ≤ 1) according to our parameter sweep experiments; the amplitude, wavelength and frequency of SIWs are sensitive to Rossby numbers. We extend the Lighthill–Ford radiation into inertial waves, and propose an indicator for the emission of inertial waves; this indicator may be adopted into general circulation models to parameterize inertial waves. Additionally, in our tracer releasing experiments, SIWs organize tracers into spirals, and modify the tracer’s local rate of change by advecting tracers vertically. Further, the spirals of SIWs resembles some spiral features observed in the ocean and atmosphere, such as spiral ocean eddies and spiral hurricane rainbands; thus, SIWs may offer another mechanism to form spiral eddies and rainbands. Since no density anomaly is required to generate the spirals of SIWs, we infer that the density anomaly, hence the baroclinic or frontal instability, is unlikely to be the key factor in the formation of these spiral features.",2016-02-01,NA,American Geophysical Union eBooks,https://openalex.org/V4306462807,American Geophysical Union,,NA,NA,NA,2016,NA,FALSE,0,,2016,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3166867678,,NA,NA,,,

It is a resilient large marine ecosystem that has changed in response to many drivers and pressures that we are only now beginning to fully understand. Coastlines of the states that border the Gulf comprise about half of the US southern seaboard, and those states are capped by the vast Midwest. The Gulf drains most of North America and is both an economic keystone and an unintended waste receptacle. It is a renowned resource for seafood markets, recreational fishing, and beach destinations and an international maritime highway fueled by vast, but limited, hydrocarbon reserves. Today, more is known about the Gulf than was imagined possible only a few years ago. That gain in knowledge was driven by one of the greatest environmental disasters of this country’s history, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The multitude of response actions and subsequent funded research significantly contributed to expanding our knowledge and, perhaps most importantly, to guiding the work needed to restore the damage from that oil spill.

We use three-dimensional fast Fourier transform and least squares fitting to measure the surface waves’ phase velocities and the currents via the linear dispersion relationship. Our UAS is a low-cost off-the-shelf quadcopter with inaccurate camera position and attitude measurements, which may cause spurious currents as large as the signal. We present a novel wave-based UAS heading and position correction, improving the image rectification accuracy by a factor of ~3.5 and the current measurements’ temporal repeatability by factors of 1.8–4.8. This validation study maps the currents at high spatiotemporal resolution (5 m and 4 s) across the ~700-m-wide tidally dominated Bear Cut channel in Miami, Florida. The UAS currents are compared to flotsam tracks, obtained through automated UAS video object detection and tracking, drifter tracks, and acoustic Doppler current profiler measurements. The root-mean-square errors of the cross- and along-channel currents are better than 0.03 m s −1 for the flotsam comparison and better than 0.06 m s −1 for the drifter comparison; the latter revealed a 0.06 m s −1 along-wind bias due to wind- and wave-driven vertical current shear.

Therefore, all submesoscale eddies identified in a time series were studied in aggregate. Statistics from these methods are illuminating but oversample identified features and cannot determine the lifetime evolution of the transient submesoscale processes. To this end, the authors apply the Topological Feature Tracking (TFT) algorithm to the problem of identifying and tracking submesoscale eddies over time. TFT identifies critical points on a set of time-ordered scalar fields and associates those points between consecutive timesteps. The procedure yields tracklets which represent spatio-temporal displacement of eddies. In this way we study the time-dependent behavior of submesoscale eddies, which are generated by a 1-km resolution submesoscale-permitting model.

https://openalex.org/W4298125957,Diagnosing Frontal Dynamics From Observations Using a Variational Approach,,"Intensive hydrographic and horizontal velocity measurements collected in the Alboran Sea enabled us to diagnose the three-dimensional dynamics of a frontal system. The sampled domain was characterized by a 40 km diameter anticyclonic eddy, with an intense front on its eastern side, separating the Atlantic and Mediterranean waters. Here, we implemented a multi-variate variational analysis (VA) to reconstruct the hydrographic fields, combining the 1-km horizontal resolution of the Underway Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) system with information on the flow shape from the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler velocities. One advantage of the VA is given by the physical constraint, which preserves fine-scale gradients better than the classical optimal interpolation (OI). A comparison between real drifter trajectories and virtual particles advected in the mapping quantified the improvements in the VA over the OI, with a 15% larger skill score. Quasi-geostrophic (QG) and semi-geostrophic (SG) omega equations enabled us to estimate the vertical velocity (w) which reached 40 m/day on the dense side of the front. How nutrients and other passive tracers leave the mixed-layer and subduct is estimated with 3D advection from the VA, which agreed with biological sampling from traditional CTD casts at two eddy locations. Downwelling warm filaments are further evidence of subduction, in line with the w from SG, but not with QG. SG better accounted for the along-isopycnal component of w in agreement with another analysis made on isopycnal coordinates. The multi-platform approach of this work and the use of variational methods improved the characterization and understanding of (sub)-mesoscale frontal dynamics.",2022-09-30,NA,Journal Of Geophysical Research: Oceans,https://openalex.org/V4210200322,Wiley,,NA,NA,NA,127,11,FALSE,0,,2022,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4298125957,,https://doi.org/10.1029/2021jc018336,journal-article,,,
